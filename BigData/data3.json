In February this year President Hilda Heine announced plans to introduce a cryptocurrency to operate as the country\u2019s second legal tender alongside the US dollar, saying her country must not remain idle but \u201cadvance into the future\u201d. The cryptocurrency, known as Sovereign or \u201cSov\u201d was to be issued by an Israeli start-up company, which, according to the International Monetary Fund has \u201climited financial sector experience\u201d. Heine said adopting the currency was \u201can alternate\u201d way for the Marshall Islands to work towards financial self-sufficiency, and the Israeli start-up had not unduly pressured the government. \u201cI don\u2019t see any indication of us being harmed \u2026 this is not an illicit activity. This is not illegal and our laws will not be tarnished,\u201d Heine said. On Monday eight senators introduced a vote of no confidence in the president. Heine was elected in 2016 and is the first female head of state in the Pacific Islands. She has earned a reputation as a passionate climate change advocate and has committed her country to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. While Heine\u2019s climate advocacy work has been widely praised by the international community, her plan to introduce the cryptocurrency has been criticised as fool-hardy. In September the IMF urged the Marshall Islands to \u201cseriously reconsider\u201d the plan, saying it \u201cwould increase macroeconomic and financial integrity risks\u201d, tarnish the government\u2019s financial reputation and make the country \u2013 which is heavily reliant on foreign aid \u2013 vulnerable to cybersecurity risks. The Marshall Islands, located about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, gained its independence in 1986 after four decades under US administration. It contains Bikini Atoll, site of nuclear testing by the US between 1947-1962. Unemployment stands at around 36%. In the report the IMF said the Israeli start-up charged with issuing Sovereign had not made plans for \u201ctransaction monitoring, reporting of suspicious transactions, compliance monitoring, and sanctioning of compliance failures\u201d. It said all cryptocurrencies were at risk of being misused for \u201cmoney laundering and terrorist financing\u201d purposes. The no confidence vote has been schedule for 12 November. Earlier this year Venezuela announced the launch of a digital currency in a bid to tackle hyperinflation. But an investigation by Reuters news agency found no evidence of the currency in use or accepted by shops anywhere in the country. President Heine was contacted for an interview but declined.", "1||How fast is a Melbourne Cup winner?

If you still want to receive the latest news from the Guardian after Wednesday, sign up for our new US morning briefing. High stakes for Nebraska progressive Democrat Kara Eastman pulled out an upset in the primary for Nebraska\u2019s 2nd congressional district. She beat former congressman Brad Ashford in a swing district that he previously represented by running hard to the left. If she wins on Tuesday, progressive groups will hail her victory and if she loses, it will be used as an example of what happens if Democrats go too far to the left in moderate areas. So will she win? It is an uphill battle. A poll from a month ago gives incumbent Republican Don Bacon a 51%-42% lead and Cook Political Report currently classifies it as Lean Republican. Georgia going to overtime? The tight gubernatorial race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp could go to a December runoff. Georgia law requires the winning candidate to get a majority of the vote and the presence of a Libertarian on the ballot could force a runoff in the tight race. Will it happen? It\u2019s quite possible and both campaigns are already preparing for the eventuality. In 2008, Georgia\u2019s US Senate race was forced to a December runoff after Republican Saxby Chambliss couldn\u2019t clear 50% against Democrat Jim Martin. Chambliss won the runoff easily. Don Jr hits the trail One of the key surrogates for Republicans in the midterms has been Donald Trump\u2019s oldest son, Don Jr. Along with his girlfriend, former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, Don Jr has been omnipresent on the stump for Republican candidates and has fired up base Republicans. Why Don Jr? The oldest Trump child has long been the most \u201cextremely online\u201d Trump child and is deeply plugged into the world of hardcore Trump fans who wear Maga hats and are fired up by Trumpian populism. Poll of the day A New York Times/Siena poll of the Illinois 14th congressional district shows Democrat Lauren Underwood with a 49%-43% lead over four-term incumbent Republican Randy Hultgren. The district is a traditionally Republican one but one where affluent suburbanites have been skeptical of Trump. Is this big? If Democrats win this district, it means they are well on their way to the House majority and picking up a number of once deep red suburban districts. Ad of the day Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending $5m on ads on the eve of the midterms that feature him speaking straight to the camera to urge moderate voters to support Democrats in the midterms. So is he running? It\u2019s hard to imagine a septuagenarian New York billionaire with an abrasive personality mounting a successful presidential bid, but stranger things have happened.", "3||Cannabis convictions: the push to clear the records that ruin livesLorenze Lanier, 32, spent his first decade as an adult in and out of prison for non-violent drug offenses. \u201cI was 18. I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I started selling drugs,\u201d he said. He was living on LA\u2019s Skid Row when he \u201ccaught\u201d his first felony. And when he realized how severely his criminal record curtailed his prospects, he felt he had no choice but to continue selling drugs. After three stints in prison, Lanier got a job at Walmart as an overnight stocker, but he didn\u2019t see much opportunity to advance further. \u201cNot only is it hard to get a job [with a criminal record], but the jobs you do get are not living-wage jobs,\u201d he said. Much of the outrage surrounding the war on drugs focuses on mass incarceration. But relatively few minor marijuana convictions lead to long-term prison sentences. Having any kind of criminal record, however, can block access to jobs as well as publicly funded housing and scholarships. Once individuals have paid their debt to society, they\u2019re cut off from ways to productively rejoin it. And as legalization continues to gain momentum, marijuana arrests have actually increased. In 2017 there were more than 650,000 marijuana arrests in the US, according to calculations by the legalization activist and journalist Tom Angell, the vast majority for minor possession offenses. The reasons are complex but often reflect the illegal market\u2019s hold on a portion of sales. While arrests have plummeted in some jurisdictions, police elsewhere have pursued pot busts more aggressively. As with virtually all drug-related law enforcement, African Americans have been disproportionately punished. In Colorado, for example, arrests of black and Latino youths jumped after legalization. The cruel irony is that at the same time, state-legal and overwhelmingly white-owned businesses now grow and sell marijuana openly on an industrial scale. \u201cMy life is destroyed while those white boys get to send their kids to college,\u201d Lanier said. But there is hope for individuals facing the shackles of past convictions. With legalization, there\u2019s been a renewed focus on expunging criminal records, especially for minor cannabis offenses. Early this year, Lanier met Bonita \u201cBo\u201d Money, a Los Angeles activist and entrepreneur who\u2019s the CEO of NDICA, a southern California group that promotes people of color in the marijuana industry. NDICA offers expungement clinics that guide convicted felons through the process, which can be intimidating and confusing. With NDICA\u2019s help, Lanier signed a few forms and got eight charges expunged within weeks. The rules, including which charges are eligible for expungement, vary widely across state and city lines. And according to organizers, a staggering 77 million Americans have criminal convictions in their past. By comparison, the US prison population, the world\u2019s largest, was just under 2.2 million in 2016. But NDICA\u2019s Money says the group has helped 318 people clear more than 600 convictions. Late October was the first national expungement week, with clinics and events held in more than 10 US cities including Washington DC, Chicago and Atlanta. And NDICA isn\u2019t the only group involved in the process. San Francisco has announced it is retroactively purging convictions \u201cautomatically,\u201d without any action required. With national recreational legalization a few weeks ago, Canada is creating an expungement program as well, though it will require an application process. For Lanier, having his record expunged has created new opportunities he thought would be permanently closed to him. With NDICA\u2019s help he has an eye on winning one of LA\u2019s equity licenses, which would allow him to open his own dispensary. He\u2019s also taking classes in HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), while continuing to work at Walmart. Having his record expunged has given him a new chance to lead a productive life.", "4||How fast is a Melbourne Cup winner?

The decision to mete out the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d comes after years of criticism regarding the organization\u2019s handling of sexual assault complaints, including those which culminated in the sex-abuse scandal involving former team doctor Larry Nassar. \u201cThis is a situation in which there are no perfect solutions,\u201d USOC CEO Sarah Hirshland said in a statement. \u201cSeeking to revoke recognition is not a conclusion that we have come to easily. In the short-term, we have to work to ensure that USAG gymnasts have the support necessary to excel on and off the field of play. We are building plans to do just that. \u201cIn the long-term, it will be the critically important responsibility of the recognized Gymnastics NGB, whether the existing organization or a new one, to lead gymnastics in the United States and build on the supportive community of athletes and clubs that can carry the sport forward for decades to come. We are prepared to identify and help build such an organization.\u201d Hirshland said Monday\u2019s complaint is the first step of a process for revocation will include the identifying of a review panel, a hearing, the issue of a report, a recommendation from the panel and a vote by the USOC board on whether or not to decertify. She added the USOC has given USA Gymnastics the option of surrender its recognition voluntarily. In an open letter to the gymnastics community, Hirshland said the challenges facing USA Gymnastics \u201care simply more than it is capable of overcoming in its current form\u201d. USA Gymnastics came under intense fire after an Indianapolis Star investigative report published shortly before the 2016 Olympics revealed several top executives dismissed or failed to properly alert authorities when notified of allegations of sexual abuse, ultimately leading to the resignation of CEO and president Steve Penny in March 2017. Five of the organization\u2019s 21 board members resigned in the immediate wake of Nassar\u2019s sentencing to an effective life prison sentence in January 2018, with the remaining directors all stepping down by the end of the month under threat of decertification by the USOC. Kerry Perry, who had succeeded Penny as CEO and president and whose nine-month tenure will be most remembered for a disastrous appearance on Capitol Hill, was forced to resign in September. Her interim replacement, Mary Bono, lasted only four days, doing little to allay concerns of institutional dysfunction. USA Gymnastics released a statement attributed to its board of directors on Monday evening, saying it is \u201ccarefully reviewing the contents of this letter and is evaluating the best path forward for our athletes, professional members, the organization and staff\u201d.", "5||Doing Money review \u2013 bleak and unforgiving story of modern slaveryThere was only one unbelievable element in Lynsey Miller\u2019s bleak and unforgiving film about modern slavery \u2013 that was that it was based on a true story. Doing Money follows Ana, a twentysomething Romanian woman living in London and working as a cleaner while she studies to be a nurse, over the course of the year after she is snatched off the street by a gang of eastern-European sex traffickers. It is breathtaking how quickly and easily it is done. They threaten to harm Ana\u2019s family \u2013 they know her mother\u2019s name and address \u2013 if she screams or tries to escape. She is taken to Ireland and stripped of her passport, glasses and phone before being forced to \u201cdo money\u201d in a series of brothels (doors locked, windows nailed shut) across the country. \u201cNobody knows where I am,\u201d she says in a voiceover. \u201cNot even me.\u201d At least until her first client arrives. \u201cWelcome to Galway,\u201d he says as he unbuckles his belt. He\u2019s not sinister. He\u2019s an ordinary man who has paid his money. Ana fights him off. \u201cShe\u2019s mad!\u201d he shouts in outrage. \u201cFine way to treat an honest customer.\u201d The man who snatched her off the street rapes her instead. His female partner-in-crime tells Ana that there will be no food unless she works. And so she works. The pimps charge extra for anal sex, sex without a condom and for special services, such as those for the men who want to beat up Ana in addition to raping her. Interwoven with this unflinching portrayal of the brutality she suffers at the hands of her pimps and of ordinary men \u2013 there is a spike in business on Thursday evenings because it is when wives go late-night shopping \u2013 is the story of the police investigating and trying to prosecute those responsible. In one raid, the chance of rescue seems possible, but all the police find is evidence of a tenancy agreement and client lists in her name. Ana now has a criminal record and returns to her pimps even more vulnerable, effectively shackled to them. A second raid is more carefully planned by a team experienced in the field of tracking and trying to prosecute modern slavers and endlessly frustrated by their lack of power. You can\u2019t remove an adult woman from her situation without her consent and the abused women they meet are too terrified to give it. \u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d mutters the youngest of Ana\u2019s fellow captives (delivered to the gang the day after her 18th birthday by a boyfriend who told her he was bringing her in for webcam work) as the police question their status in front of their pimp. \u201cI\u2019m free.\u201d The sketching of the police investigation and the difficulties they face is possibly done too lightly in a film that is clearly intended as agitprop. The investigators need to be more than ciphers and the law\u2019s inadequacies and otiose requirements need to be hammered home at least as hard as the horrors the women suffer, because we are unlikely to feel the same emotional response to the former as we do to the latter. That emotional response also allows the viewer to skim over an underpowered script and some narrative solutions that seem rather too neat to be true, even if \u2013 such is the weird way storytelling on screen works \u2013 they are. Take, for example, the local gangster who turns out to have a heart of gold and the relative ease with which Ana decides to testify against those who held her. Vitally, however, neither of these flaws is great enough to detract from the power of and the suffering in Ana\u2019s story. Her experience is representative of the 5 million women and girls who, we are told in a caption at the end, endured such sexual exploitation last year. The real Ana\u2019s testimony in parliament in Belfast helped secure the passing of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act \u2013 the first new law against slavery in the UK for nearly 200 years. I don\u2019t like to think what this says about how far we have come in the intervening years. But one thing I like to think about even less is that, among all the women watching this programme and thinking: \u201cThere but for the grace of God,\u201d and all the men watching aghast at this awful underbelly of the world, there will be a tiny fraction who look at the pimps or the rapists they facilitate and think: \u201cThere\u2019s an idea \u2026\u201d And so the world turns.

But the Spain striker is now more at ease in body and mind and reaping the benefits. Two goals against Crystal Palace on Sunday swelled Morata\u2019s recent tally to five in six matches, a burst more reminiscent of his prolific start at Stamford Bridge following a \u00a358m transfer from Real Madrid in the summer of 2017. His previous 31 matches had yielded four goals after a back injury, which flared in January and initially baffled the medical staff, blunted his impact. The forward is now restored to fitness but a player whom Maurizio Sarri acknowledged as \u201cfragile\u201d after the weekend\u2019s 3-1 win admits his real battle has been to recover mentally from last season\u2019s toils. \u201cThe most important thing is that, finally, I have found the right way and my head is OK,\u201d Morata said. \u201cIn football physical condition is veryimportant but the head is the most important thing. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the head, if the mentality is not good, then you are in trouble. I\u2019m better. \u201cNo one, only my wife, knows how big the last year was. Now it\u2019s OK. In the last month of last season I was down, down, down, down. I cannot be more down. When you touch the limit, the only thing you can do is to come back. \u201cIt takes long because I had an injury, I was not fit when playing, but now I feel good. I had a period where everything \u2026 if it was raining, I was angry because it\u2019s raining; if I miss, it\u2019s because the pitch is too wet. It was only excuses. It is not good. \u201cHonestly, last year I was always joking in the dressing room at the beginning because I started well and was scoring goals. But the injury, it killed me, because the doctors didn\u2019t know what I had. It was strange. Sometimes when you know you are out for one month, it\u2019s OK in your head, because you know it is one month. But when you are trying to give your best and you are not in your best moment, it\u2019s difficult. Now, that\u2019s the past. \u201cEveryone can have a bad period in their life. But we are famous, we have a lot of things. Sometimes people think we are not human, with no feelings, with no problems. The important thing is to find the right balance. \u201cNow, I have, and I am very happy. The important thing is the team. I know that sometimes I am in the middle of all the criticism when the team drops [points] or when the team loses. But it doesn\u2019t matter. I want to win with this team and we have a very good chance.\u201d Morata, whose wife gave birth to twins in July, might have completed a hat-trick against Palace only to opt to chip Wayne Hennessey, at 6ft 6in, from close range after sprinting through on goal in stoppage time. \u201cI suffered a lot in the past and needed to score three for myself, for my team and for the supporters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very important for me. Honestly, I think I missed because I had only this in my head. \u201cIf I don\u2019t think, probably I score. In the last 10 minutes I only have in my head \u2018I want to bring the ball home\u2019 and that\u2019s why I missed. The goalkeeper did well. I thought he\u2019d go down and I forgot he\u2019s a keeper who is two metres tall and that\u2019s why I failed. But I\u2019m improving and this is the important thing.\u201d", "6||England players not consulted over Wayne Rooney\u2019s farewell appearanceEngland\u2019s players were not consulted by Gareth Southgate over the plan to offer Wayne Rooney a farewell appearance for the team, with the manager still considering which shirt to allocate the forward in the friendly against the United States. Rooney will come out of international retirement to gain his 120th cap when he makes a brief substitute\u2019s appearance at Wembley on 15 November. The Football Association has designated the game The Wayne Rooney Foundation International, with the 33-year-old\u2019s foundation one of a number of charities which will benefit from the proceeds. England\u2019s record goalscorer will be an additional selection on top of the squad Southgate would normally have selected and will announce on Thursday. The DC United striker will join up with the rest of the party at St George\u2019s Park next week with England ostensibly using the USA match as preparation for their last, and potentially critical, Nations League tie against Croatia on 18 November. Rooney will have a cameo role in the friendly and it remains to be seen whether Southgate allows him to wear his usual No 10 shirt off the bench. The FA\u2019s promotional imagery for the game \u2013 albeit for advertising purposes \u2013 have shown Rooney in the shirt he effectively inherited from Michael Owen and went on to wear for much of his 13-year England career, including the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, and European Championships in 2012 and 2016. Raheem Sterling, who scored twice in the impressive 3-2 win in Spain last month, is the current No 10 having worn the shirt at the World Cup in Russia. It remains to be seen whether Sterling will be selected against USA given the match\u2019s proximity to the Croatia fixture. Yet the Manchester City forward, in scintillating form, would expect to be notified if Rooney were to reclaim the shirt, even as a one-off. Southgate is apparently aware that allowing Rooney to come off the bench wearing No 10 would prompt some raised eyebrows. England use allocated squad numbers only at major tournaments and, unlike other nations, line up 1-11 with replacements taking higher numbers. Rooney\u2019s 118th cap, a goalless draw with Slovenia in Ljubljana, saw him come on for the last 17 minutes wearing No 18.", "6||J\u00fcrgen Klopp: leaving out Shaqiri against Red Star is common senseJ\u00fcrgen Klopp has denied omitting Xherdan Shaqiri from Liverpool\u2019s Champions League trip to Red Star Belgrade over security concerns and insisted it made sense \u201cto cool the situation down\u201d at the hostile Rajko Mitic Stadium. Kosovo-born Shaqiri was left behind when the Liverpool squad flew to Serbia on Monday with his manager seeking to avoid controversy around the tie. Klopp admitted politics influenced his decision; the Switzerland international incensed Serbia after his 90th- minute winner against them at the World Cup. Shaqiri was fined 10,000 Swiss francs by Fifa for celebrating by forming a double-headed eagle with his hands \u2013 as represented on the flag of Albania, who fought against Serbia in the Kosovo war \u2013 and sparked a complaint from the Serbia FA for sporting a Kosovo flag on his boots. Klopp\u2019s decision has been welcomed by Serbian media and Red Star officials who believe it has defused a potentially volatile situation and the threat of Uefa sanctions. Red Star\u2019s sporting director, Zvezdan Terzic, cautioned against Shaqiri playing when the draw was made, but Liverpool\u2019s manager insists there was nothing sinister behind his selection. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely not aware of any security issues,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThe only thing I can say about it was that it was common sense. It was common sense to make the decision and not to force anything. We come here wanting to play football. We have to concentrate on football. We have to focus on football. That\u2019s what we want to do and that is why I made that decision.\u201d Shaqiri said after Liverpool\u2019s 4-0 defeat of Red Star at Anfield last month that he wanted to play in the return game and could \u201chandle it, no problem\u201d. His reaction when told that would not be the case, Klopp said, was: \u201c\u2018OK, boss.\u2019 That was the decision and with the decision the discussion ended at that moment.\u201d The Liverpool manager was taken aback by the focus on Shaqiri\u2019s omission, something he thought would be avoided once his squad was announced. \u201cMy job and your job as well is not to do questions which provoke a kind of answer,\u201d said Klopp, who asked the Serbian interpreter to ensure this answer about the political nature of his decision was translated 100% accurately. \u201cWe need to cool the situation down. We are in Serbia, we respect that 100%. That\u2019s how the world is. Politics always has influence on life, on the life I live at least, and that\u2019s how it is. But we are not here for that, we are here to play football. We tried to make sure we can be focused on football. I expected it differently but most of the English-speaking journalists were asking about it, to be honest. \u201cIt could have been a story but we didn\u2019t want to have a story besides a football story. That\u2019s why we decided what we decided.\u201d Klopp admits a priority for Liverpool in Belgrade \u2013 irrespective of the Shaqiri situation \u2013 will be to silence a stadium known as the \u201cMarakana\u201d and renowned for its intimidating atmosphere. Liverpool beat Red Star comfortably last month but the Serbian champions have not lost at home for over a year. The defender Andy Robertson said: \u201cAt Anfield we scored at the right times and we\u2019re at 100%. I think they\u2019re a different beast when they\u2019re at home. I think they proved that against Napoli, getting the draw. They\u2019ll be hoping to use that to their advantage and hopefully we\u2019ll quieten the crowd.\u201d Naby Ke\u00efta has travelled having missed Liverpool\u2019s last four games with a hamstring injury. Jordan Henderson remains sidelined with the same problem but is expected to resume full training with the squad later this week. Klopp views the game against Red Star as an opportunity to take control of a tight group including Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain but knows Tuesday\u2019s opponents will be smarting from their heavy defeat at Anfield. \u201cIt would help massively,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we could win here it would give us a bit of control but only until the next game because everything is open again. Even if Paris loses, they can still get 10 points by winning the two games, and the last one is here. It is really important you focus on the job ahead of you because it is so difficult here, so different. I never played here but what I heard about it since I was growing up is that it is a very tough place, historically a tough place to go. They will try everything. \u201cIt is a very proud nation and a very proud club, losing 4-0 away, no supporters there, it\u2019s all a little bit in their favour with what they can use for motivation. They will shout like they usually shout in two games. The job for us is to cool that down with the football we play. It\u2019s a challenge. This is a proud football club and they want to strike back.\u201d", "7||Headteacher acclaimed by Tories is banned from teachingThe headteacher of a high profile multi-academy trust, which won plaudits from former prime minister David Cameron and his then education secretary Michael Gove, has been banned from teaching indefinitely. Liam Nolan, who was executive headteacher and chief executive of the now defunct Perry Beeches academy trust in Birmingham, was found guilty of \u201cunacceptable professional conduct\u201d after a hearing before the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA). Acknowledging Nolan\u2019s contribution to the teaching profession, the TRA report said he should be allowed to apply to have the prohibition order lifted after a minimum two-year period, which would give him time to \u201creflect on his failings\u201d. The prohibition order against Nolan is the latest chapter in the demise of the Perry Beeches academy chain, which was stripped of its five schools after an investigation revealed financial irregularities at the trust, including third-party payments to Nolan, on top of his \u00a3120,000 salary as executive headteacher. The Education Funding Agency investigation found nearly \u00a31.3m in payments without contracts to a third-party supplier, a private company called Nexus. That company also subcontracted to a company named Liam Nolan Ltd, paying Nolan a second salary for his role as chief executive officer of the trust. At the time, critics of the government\u2019s academies policy, which takes schools out of local authority control, said the case should ring alarm bells over the accountability and financial management of academy chains and the government\u2019s ability to police the system. The TRA hearing found that Nolan failed to comply with recognised procedures and principles in relation to management of public funds and was in breach of the academies\u2019 financial handbook, which sets out the financial management, control and reporting requirements for all academy trusts. \u201cMr Nolan stated in his evidence that he was under pressure in developing the Perry Beeches schools and that it was against this background that he made what he described as mistakes,\u201d the TRA report said. \u201cHowever, the panel was not convinced this justified his lack of integrity in managing public finances. Although Mr Nolan apologised for some of his failings as accounting officer, there did not appear to be sufficient insight into the seriousness of those failings or his responsibility in that post.\u201d Cameron opened one of Perry Beeches\u2019 new free schools in 2013, when the then prime minister praised the \u201cbrilliant team\u201d at the trust. In 2012, Nolan addressed the Conservative party conference and appeared on stage with the then education secretary Michael Gove, who described Nolan as \u201cwonderful\u201d.", "6||Huddersfield Town 1-0 Fulham: Premier League \u2013\u00a0as it happenedDavid Wagner speaks. \u201cThis is huge for us.

I don\u2019t care how we performed football-wise. Everybody has seen the pressure was on for both teams, but the spirit we showed, we left everything on the grass. In the first half, we deserved to lead and in the second half we kept them out.\u201d Read our match report of events in west Yorkshire: As for Fulham, they were poor. Really poor. Slavisa Jokanovic\u2019s side may have conceded just the one goal, but they looked frail every time Huddersfield \u2013 who had not scored at home since April \u2013 went on the attack. Going forward, Mitrovic kept going, but they offered precious little, with Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle missing what was probably their best chance, and it was hardly an open goal. It was in midfield where Fulham were really overruled; Cairney was largely anonymous, while Seri and Anguissa went missing. Hogg and Billing ran the show. Next up for Fulham? A trip to Anfield on Sunday. For now, it doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. Wagner is doing a lap of the pitch, basking in all of the applause thrown at him and his players. The Huddersfield supporters are absolutely loving it. That result moves them above Cardiff and Fulham, level on points with Newcastle. A priceless victory for David Wagner\u2019s side, with a first-half own goal by Timothy Fosu-Mensah ultimately the difference. It is a sixth straight defeat for Fulham, who slide to the bottom of the table, with Huddersfield leapfrogging them into 18th. The John Smith\u2019s Stadium is rocking, and it\u2019s the happiest of anniversaries of Wagner, who is celebrating three years in the job today. What now for Slavisa Jokanovic and his side? His Fulham side were simply not at that races from start to finish. Rico, the goalkeeper, and Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle fall to their knees. For the hosts, a special mention for the central-midfield pairing of Jonathan Hogg and Philip Billing who made Cairney, Seri and co look plain ordinary. 90+2 min: Bacuna revs up the home crowd. They\u2019re up on their feet bouncing, 90 seconds or so away from their first Premier League win of the season. 90+1 min: Mbenza\u2019s effort is deflected wide off Le Marchand for a corner. Aaron Mooy takes an age to get to the corner flag. Huddersfield play a bit of keep-ball, with Depoitre holding off the challenge before Bacuna wins a foul. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. 90 min: Bacuna replaces Terence Kongolo. 88 min: Huddersfield are knackered, but Billing wins a free-kick just inside their own half. The home support react as if they\u2019ve scored a second. They can taste that first win of the season. 86 min: Seri whips in a smart corner, but Mitrovic\u2019s header is blocked. Fulham are staring at sixth straight league defeat. 85 min: Fulham dink the ball over the top of the Huddersfield defence in search of Mitrovic \u2013 but Lossl rushes out of goal to head the ball clear. And now Kongolo heads out Sessegnon\u2019s deep cross for a corner. It\u2019s kitchen-sink time. 83 min: Mbenza\u2019s involved straight away, but he really should do better. He shanks an effort painfully wide, after being slipped through on goal by Billing. As well as getting it all wrong, the loanee, only seconds after coming on, perhaps took it too early. Unfashionable, but Billing\u2019s been superb. 82 min: Isaac Mbenza comes on for his seventh Premier League appearance, replacing the impressive Alex Pritchard. 80 min: Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle is played in Cairney, but the German, who opens up his body to wrap his right foot around the ball, cannot get his effort on target. He had Jorgensen back-pedalling and Lossl worried. That was a big chance given how few and far between they have been for Fulham tonight. 79 min: Billing does well, snuffing the ball out from Cyrus Christie who had hoped to propel himself down the right wing. Fulham have grown in momentum, largely because of pumping the ball that bit longer to Mitrovic, but this is probably their best spell of the evening. Huddersfield, meanwhile, are readying changes. 77 min: Mitrovic does superbly to buy a free-kick out of Jorgensen. Rico wellies the ball downfield, and the striker shoves the defender aside and backs into his marker. He holds up play, before being fouled. Fulham look to play it quickly, but then Cairney\u2019s stopped in his tracks. Seri\u2019s free-kick drops wide of goal. 75 min: Suddenly, Fulham are three-on-two but Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle is flagged offside. He wanted the pass to be a little quicker. Aleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s frustrations earn him a booking. 74 min: Kongolo clips Mitrovic, earning Fulham a free-kick on halfway. Instead of lumping it forward, they patiently build, but Mitrovic is flagged yards offside by the time that Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle lashes the ball beyond Lossl. 71 min: Huddersfield break down the left, with Pritchard beating the offside trap before shimmying down the left. Depoitre is among those awaiting the cross, but the winger fails to really get his head up and makes a mess of it. Le Marchand duly clears. Moments before, Schindler made a smart block on Mitrovic. 70 min: To make things worse, Cairney doesn\u2019t seem to be moving too freely. He just appeared to signal to the Fulham bench that he needed to come off. 67 min: The corner drops in the box and Pritchard unleashes a stinging first-time effort from the edge of the area! It jets just over Sergio Rico\u2019s goal. Huddersfield could do with a bit of breathing space and very nearly made some. 66 min: Philip Billing does brilliantly again, nicking the ball in midfield. He\u2019s totally bossed things in the middle of the park. Huddersfield stream forward down the right, again through Florent Hadergjonaj and win another corner. 64 min: Kevin McDonald, the Fulham substitute, is in trouble and is replaced by Stefan Johansen. Things go from bad to worse, as Jokanovic is forced into making his third and final change of the evening. They haven\u2019t got a lot else on the bench anyway, really. Except a sea of defenders. 63 min: Rico slices a routine clearance up into the gods, before Sessegnon fails to get the ball under control, instead it cannons off his shin and out of play. That sums it up. 62 min: The Premier League confirm the news that Christopher Schindler had feared: \u201cFollowing review, the Huddersfield goal has been adjudged to be a Timothy Fosu-Mensah own goal,\u201d the league says. 59 min: Kevin McDonald plays a clever ball over the top of the Huddersfield defence, but Mitrovic is eventually flagged offside. Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle, who was in close proximity, would have been onside. Never mind. Fulham could do with a bit more of that, to give Huddersfield something to think about at least. 57 min: Le Marchand lashes the ball out of play, allowing Huddersfield to pen Fulham back in and gain some territory in the process. 56 min: Laurent Depoitre\u2019s name is being sung loud and proud around the John Smith\u2019s Stadium; the stuff of dreams. 55 min: Florent Hadergjonaj flies down the right-hand side, but Sessegnon does well to just usher the defender away from goal. Meanwhile, Wagner does make his first change, but it\u2019s Laurent Depoitre, on in place of Mouni\u00e9. 54 min: Fulham win a couple of corners in quick succession. Mitrovic\u2019s first effort is deflected wide before steering his second wide of goal altogether. 52 min: Billing is back up and moving. Good news. 50 min: Philip Billing is in pain on halfway after a clash with Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri. David Wagner looks as though he\u2019s going to be forced into a change. 49 min: ... Mouni\u00e9 wins the header from the long throw, flicking on for Mooy and Jorgensen, but Fulham just about clear their lines. That was so simple. 48 min: Florent Hadergjonaj does well to help out Steve Mouni\u00e9 down the right flank, winning a throw-in which will be launched in by Philip Billing. 47 min: Cyrus Christie bombs down the right and wins an early corner. Mitrovic is lurking on the edge of the box but Huddersfield\u2019s Jorgensen get in to make the block. Fulham have shown more intensity in 90-odd seconds than that dire first 45 minutes. 46 min: Fulham get us back under way. What kind of reaction might we see? Jokanovic had to change something. They surely can\u2019t play much worse. A double change for Fulham at the break, with Cyrus Christie and Kevin McDonald summoned. Luciano Vietto and Fosu-Mensah have been hooked. Fulham have been a shadow of their old self, second-best and sloppy. Ryan Sessegnon\u2019s brother, for one, is not overly impressed with Fulham\u2019s first-half display, nor Slavisa Jokanovic\u2019s selection. Chris Sessegnon tweets \u201cYou\u2019re playing last years top goal scorer LEFT BACK. OMDSSSS\u201d, six minutes after saying \u201cI\u2019m acc not watching this anymore\u201d, and that 12 minutes after: \u201cThis is so bad.\u201d Christopher Schindler\u2019s second goal of the season is the difference at the interval, with the Huddersfield captain\u2019s header ending the 658-minute goal drought on home soil. Fulham have been painfully poor, with Huddersfield running rings round their backline. Denis Odoi and Maxime Le Marchand have looked unconvincing at best, while Sessegnon and Fosu-Mensah have been repeatedly caught out at full-back. And Sessegnon can count himself fortunate not to have been pulled up for a foul on Florent Hadergjonaj inside the box just before the half-time whistle. 45+1 min: Rico claws the ball back into play to make a save from a Huddersfield corner before Fulham go up the other end and win one themselves. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. 44 min: No penalty! Florent Hadergjonaj is felled in the box by Ryan Sessegnon. There is definitely a sneaky trip by the teenager on the Huddersfield full-back as he surges towards the byline, but Anthony Taylor\u2019s not having any of it. The home appeals are in vain. 43 min: Cairney pings the ball all the way back to Rico in the Fulham goal from almost halfway. That sums things up for them, really. They\u2019ve looked second-best, bereft of confidence and totally out of ideas. 41 min: Huddersfield are working Fulham so hard, and Slavisa Jokanovic\u2019s side just don\u2019t know where to turn next. Jorgensen does really well to pen in the Fulham defence, before Le Marchand eventually hacks the ball clear. 38 min: Vietto dinks the ball just wide of goal ... but the linesman\u2019s flag had been up for a while. It was good play by Sessegnon, driving down the left. 37 min: Thirty-seven minutes played and Fulham have been desperately poor. They\u2019ve made Huddersfield look like world beaters in patches. 35 min: Christopher Schindler\u2019s second goal of the season makes him Huddersfield\u2019s top scorer. His goal is also his team\u2019s first at home since 14 April, when Tom Ince struck against Watford. That\u2019s a 658-minute wait. 34 min: Fosu-Mensah chops down Chris L\u00f6we and picks up a yellow card for his efforts. Soon after, he gifts a routine pass straight infield to Jonathan Hogg. 32 min: Pritchard\u2019s movement is causing no end of problems for a panicky Fulham back line. Le Marchand, preferred to Tim Ream, has not covered himself in glory so far tonight. Down both flanks, Huddersfield are finding joy against Sessegnon and Fosu-Mensah. Defensively, Fulham are a mess. 30 min: The home supporters are up on their feet, they\u2019re absolutely loving this. It\u2019s one-way traffic at the moment, with Huddersfield in the ascendency. Advantage Huddersfield. Schindler thumps a downward header beyond Rico, via Fosu-Mensah, converting Chris L\u00f6we\u2019s ball in after the initial corner was cleared. How will Fulham react? 27 min: Rico gets out a strong left hand to deny Pritchard! The winger darts inside after Florent Hadergjonaj stood up Sessegnon. Pritchard drifts infield before his stinging effort is deflected wide by Le Marchand. Billing initially did well, keeping Cairney and Anguissa at arm\u2019s length before kickstarting another move. 25 min: Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri plays a weak pass back to Odoi, and Mooy comes bundling in to make the challenge. He catches him, but he meant well. Fulham, last season so assured and cute in possession last season, have been largely wasteful so far. 23 min: A neat give-and-go releases Mooy down the left, exposing Denis Odoi in the same breath. His cross is cut out, but Huddersfield ripped open Fulham there. Chris L\u00f6we did well initially, driving forward unchallenged before Pritchard\u2019s neat interchange with Mooy, who has enjoyed plenty of the ball. 22 min: Mouni\u00e9 heads over! Aaron Mooy twists and turns away from Timothy Fosu-Mensah to buy himself a yard of space. He swings in a lovely ball with his right foot, and the Huddersfield striker rises above Le Marchand to nod a header wide. It was always going wide, but still, more encouragement for the hosts. 20 min: Schindler comes charging out of defence, crashing a headed clearance into touch. Lovely stuff, and the home fans sound their appreciation. Fulham are starting to see more of the ball, but it\u2019s still Huddersfield in the driving seat. 18 min: Fulham carve an opening down the left, after a good challenge by Vietto. It\u2019s a meaty challenge, but Anthony Taylor\u2019s happy with it. He then plays in the marauding Sessegnon, but Huddersfield get a block in. Back to square one for the visitors. 17 min: Fulham struggle to retain possession, with Anguissa and then Odoi both guilty of perhaps trying too much. Huddersfield sense their over-exuberance and win the ball back. They just need to calm things down a bit. 16 min: Mitrovic backs into Schindler, but the Huddersfield skipper stands tall to ease out the Serbia striker. Mitrovic has just come alive the last few minutes. 15 min: Billing smashes the crossbar! What an effort! It\u2019s a stinging left-footed effort from almost 30 yards. Huddersfield did brilliantly to turn over possession in the first place, with Jonathan Hogg mugging Mitrovic, who had come deep in search of the ball. Fulham survive; Rico would have had no chance with that. 13 min: In the end it\u2019s Chris L\u00f6we who flights in the ball in, but Steve Mouni\u00e9 cannot make any firm contact with the cross. Meanwhile, Anthony Taylor is having a few technical difficulties with his earpiece, but luckily the fourth official Jon Moss is on hand to help a brother out. Jokanovic just wants to get on with it. 12 min: Le Marchand is penalised for another foul on Alex Pritchard, who has enjoyed a lively start. Florent Hadergjonaj was again instrumental in the buildup to that move. Aaron Mooy will swing it in from the right, 25 yards from goal ... 11 min: Wagner is prowling his technical area. He should be fairly happy with this start. Fulham have been pretty anonymous, except for that little scare all of Huddersfield\u2019s own doing when Kongolo left his goalkeeper a little short. 9 min: Fosu-Mensah goes long in search of Mitrovic, who does well but Schindler steals in to nab the ball away from Sch\u00fcrrle. The German forward has not exactly made a brilliant start this game. 8 min: Sessegnon looks to play in Sch\u00fcrrle down the left, but Huddersfield soon snuff it out. They press forward, with Mouni\u00e9 doing well after more good work by Florent Hadergjonaj bombing infield. 6 min: Huddersfield attack down the left, with Pritchard robbing Le Marchand of the ball and then Chris L\u00f6we whipping in a cross from the opposite flank, forcing Sessegnon to steer the ball away from danger. 5 min: Another plucky foul by Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle earns Huddersfield a free-kick deep inside their own half. In fact, the hosts get away with one, with a sloppy and undercooked back pass by Kongolo dealt with by L\u00f6ssl with Vietto lurking. 4 min: Mooy and Pritchard combine, but the latter\u2019s pass in search of Florent Hadergjonaj is cut out by Sessegnon. Huddersfield go again, this time probing down the left after Philip Billing holds off a challenge in midfield. 2 min: Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle scathes down Florent Hadergjonaj, so Huddersfield can build an attack. They look in the mood, Fulham a little panicked. They will have to soak up some early pressure by the hosts. 1 min: Huddersfield start on the front foot, penning Fulham in with the early high press. Sessegnon has a throw-in down the left. And Huddersfield get us under way, after an impeccable minute\u2019s silence in honour of the five people who lost their lives in the Leicester helicopter crash. Both sets of players have warmed up in special T-shirts, with the words #TogetherWithLeicester, and the respective club crests. The John Smith\u2019s Stadium is slowly filling up ahead of kick-off. It\u2019s a supremely foggy evening in Huddersfield. Is that a sign of what\u2019s in store? It ought to be entertaining fare, with two hopeless defences pitting their wits against one another. Fulham have shipped 17 goals in five games, Huddersfield a meagre 10. The Championship must feel a world ago now for Fulham, but they beat the Terriers by an aggregate score of 9-1 in their two matches in 2016-17, before David Wagner\u2019s side won that improbable promotion. Both teams badly need a victory. Headline team news: Fulham captain Tom Cairney starts his first Premier League game since August, while Maxime Le Marchand is preferred to Tim Ream in defence alongside Denis Odoi in the only change. Conceding goals has been Fulham\u2019s achilles heel, so there is a shed load of defenders on the bench, with Cyrus Christie, Alfie Mawson, Calum Chambers and Ream all making up the numbers. For Huddersfield, fit-again Kongolo, Hadergjonaj and Mouni\u00e9 come into the starting XI in place of Durm, Mbenza and Depoitre. Huddersfield Town: L\u00f6ssl; L\u00f6we, Schindler, Jorgensen, Hadergjonaj; Kongolo, Mooy, Pritchard, Hogg, Billing; Mouni\u00e9 Subs: Hamer, Smith, Bacuna, Sobhi, van La Parra, Mbenza, Depoitre Fulham: Rico; Fosu-Mensah, Odoi, Le Marchand, Sessegnon; Cairney, Anguissa, Seri; Vietto, Mitrovic, Sch\u00fcrrle Subs: Bettinelli, Christie, Mawson, Chambers, Ream, McDonald, Johansen Referee: Anthony Taylor So, could this be it? Could this be the evening Huddersfield Town register their first win of the season and get that monkey off their backs, or will Fulham rediscover that winning feeling in west Yorkshire? Slavisa Jokanovic\u2019s side have looked badly out of sorts, defensively frail and dreadfully naive. Rather than supplement what stock they already had, a lavish \u00a3100m summer spree has rocked the boat, so much so that a sixth straight defeat would probably leave Jokanovic out of work. It is all a rather sad indictment of how quickly things can change, with Jokanovic rightly lauded for the football his side en route to promotion via Wembley last season. \u201cThis kind of situation is part of football. I am not here three days, I am here three years and the board must have some kind of opinion about my work,\u201d Jokanovic said. \u201cFrom my side, I have the confidence, and believe in my job.\u201d His hungry group, harmonious squad and slick operation of last season feels a long, long time ago, with Jokanovic instead playing pick \u2019n mix with his squad, seemingly at a loss of knowing his best team. At the back, injuries have not helped, but none of Timothy Fosu-Mensah, Alfie Mawson nor Maxime Le Marchand have covered themselves in glory. The goalkeeping situation has been downright strange, with Sergio Rico, Fabri and Marcus Bettinelli taking it turns in between the sticks. Meanwhile, the ever-present midfield axis of Stefan Johansen, Tom Cairney and Kevin McDonald has also been broken up, with Jean Michael Seri and Frank Anguissa among those to command central roles. Huddersfield, who could welcome back club-record signing Terence Kongolo after illness, have been equally hopeless, but David Wagner is adamant his team are close to a big result. \u201cEveryone feels that we are ready and that we really want to take this opportunity,\u201d he said. Kick-off: 8pm (GMT)", "1||Eddie Jones leans on England\u2019s Lions to build dossier on defeating New ZealandEngland have compiled a dossier on how to beat the All Blacks based on information from the British &amp; Irish Lions players who toured New Zealand last year. Eddie Jones also hopes the input of the former All Blacks coach John Mitchell, now in England\u2019s camp, will enable his side to \u201cclimb Everest\u201d by toppling the world\u2019s No 1 side on Saturday. Jones, optimistic both Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes will be fit, says England aim to take a leaf out of the Lions book at Twickenham. \u201cWhen our boys played for the Lions we got them to do notes about what they felt worked and didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through those notes and had a meeting with the senior players. The Lions put a lot of pressure on the All Blacks in areas they didn\u2019t enjoy. There\u2019s a bit to be learned there.\u201d Heaping pressure on the New Zealand lineout and playmakers such as Beauden Barrett certainly played a part in the Lions\u2019 1-1 series draw in the summer of 2017 and Jones believes his team can go one better. \u201cWe need to be absolutely brutal upfront and we need to be clinical when we get opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look back at that Lions series, the Lions would have won if they had been more clinical.\u201d With the flanker Tom Curry sidelined Jones accepts it will not be easy. \u201cWhen you beat New Zealand, you climb Everest. Rugby means so much to them. When they win the whole country\u2019s buoyant, when they lose GDP falls and unemployment goes up. I don\u2019t think [England beating South Africa] will have such a significant effect on Brexit here. Imagine if Theresa May comes out and says: \u2018We got the result because we hung in there.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d After Owen Farrell\u2019s contentious tackle in the final moments of Saturday\u2019s Springboks game, Jones believes modern Tests are so intense they should be controlled by two referees. \u201cAt some stage in the future, probably not in my time, they may have to look at two referees on the field. We are asking one referee to do it the way they did it when blokes like me were playing, jogging round the field basically,\u201d he said.", "6||Huddersfield claim first win after own goal sinks Fulham to the bottomIf good things are supposed to come to those who wait, few had waited longer than Huddersfield Town and few, as the roar at the John Smith\u2019s Stadium at the final whistle showed, enjoyed their reward more. This was not just a first win of the season; not when they had gone 205 days without scoring a home goal, a 659-minute barren streak that threatened to make them the wrong sort of history-makers. Instead that mantle settles on Fulham. As Huddersfield avoided the ignominy of joining the Mansfield team of 1971-72 as the only English sides to fail to score in the first six home games of a league season, Fulham equalled Southampton\u2019s divisional record by conceding 29 times in their first 11 games of a Premier League season. Yet while the statistical distinction is unwanted, Slavisa Jokanovic has more immediate concerns after Fulham\u2019s worst start to a top-flight season deteriorated further. A sequence of six straight defeats imperils his position. With a trip to Liverpool next he may approach the international break with some trepidation. \u201cI personally trust in myself,\u201d said Jokanovic. But he accepted his fate depends on those who let him down on Monday night. \u201cIt is outside of my control,\u201d added the Serb. \u201cIt is not only in my hands. Part of the job is in the hands of my players.\u201d They conducted a post-match inquest in the dressing room. \u201cMy players have some words after the game but it is a little bit late then.\u201d \u201cReally sorry everyone\u201d was the message on the club\u2019s Twitter feed at the end. Such apologies were probably not envisaged when Fulham spent \u00a3100m in the summer. This has the potential to be the most expensive relegation of them all and, given the resources, one of the more avoidable. Fulham have the talent but showed little of the character the victorious manager, David Wagner, identified in his Huddersfield side. \u201cThey seem to be a little bit scared,\u201d Jokanovic admitted. \u201cMaybe we didn\u2019t understand how important this game is. We were a little bit confused. We didn\u2019t play the first 45 minutes with enough intensity.\u201d Perhaps his most remarkable admission about a side with footballing principles was: \u201cWe started to kick the ball without any sense.\u201d Given Fulham\u2019s self-destructive tendencies it was sadly symbolic that they donated the only goal, Timothy Fosu-Mensah being debited with Huddersfield\u2019s winner. Thereafter it was indicative of their fortunes that Kevin McDonald, who came on in a half-time double switch, lasted only 20 minutes. Change is a constant. Jokanovic has named a different defence every game this season and is no nearer to finding a formula for clean sheets. Fosu-Mensah inadvertently applied the finishing touch when two Germans combined, Christopher Schindler meeting Chris L\u00f6we\u2019s cross, to make it a happy anniversary for a third. \u201cSometimes everything comes together,\u201d said Wagner, who was tasked with avoiding relegation to League One when appointed in November 2015. \u201cThree years I am here, this was my 50th win and for sure one of the most important because, after such a long period, you need this feeling.\u201d The sensation of scoring at home was novel enough. Philip Billing had struck the bar with a thunderbolt and Alex Pritchard drew a fine save from Sergio Rico to add to their litany of near-misses. \u201cIf you hit the bar and post as often as we have, you think: \u2018Come on, what is going on here?\u2019 Huddersfield\u2019s previous home goal came so long ago that the scorer, Thomas Ince, has since made 15 appearances for Stoke. While he has returned to the Championship Huddersfield approached their task in a manner to suggest they will not go down without a fight. \u201cIf you don\u2019t bring passion and aggression you have no chance,\u201d said Schindler. Huddersfield displayed both in considerable quantities. He, Billing and Aaron Mooy were outstanding. Their team mates were willing allies. \u201cThe guys delivered,\u201d said Wagner. \u201cWe showed spirit and fighting intensity and in the second half, we were able to bring the result over the line. We know it is possible to deliver in big-pressure games.\u201d Huddersfield have already won a relegation battle and limited Fulham to one shot on target. The beaten manager sought solace from the past after consulting last year\u2019s league table. \u201cAfter 11 games Crystal Palace had four points and didn\u2019t get relegated,\u201d Jokanovic observed. But, and while he did not mention it, only after changing their manager.", "8||We let \u2018male genius\u2019 excuse bad behaviour \u2013 but what about the loss of female genius?The rising tide of famous men named in the post-Weinstein era of the #MeToo movement has exposed what many of us have long understood to be true \u2013 that powerful male \u201cgenius\u201d is regarded not just as a law unto itself but as so essential to the world that it must be allowed to unfurl itself where and how it pleases. We\u2019re seeing this view expressed once again as Geoffrey Rush\u2019s defamation case against the Daily Telegraph continues. Rush is suing the Sydney tabloid for publishing claims he \u201cbehaved inappropriately\u201d towards a fellow performer while appearing in King Lear for the Sydney Theatre Company. In April, an affidavit filed to the federal court described Rush as a \u201cvirtually housebound\u201d figure who \u201cwakes up every morning with a terrible sense of dread about his future career\u201d. Rush denies the allegations and, since they first appeared, he has been predictably surrounded by a chorus of support from people who cannot help but worry about what irrevocable damage will be done to the world if one less man is heralded within it. The same fears announced themselves during the confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh. Will no one think of the men\u2019s prestigious careers? But this collective angst is misplaced, and not just because the protection offered to privileged men grossly overestimates their general importance to the world. Geoffrey Rush is a fine enough actor, but the world would quite easily survive not seeing him in another film or on stage. He at least has had decades of opportunity. You want to talk about ruined careers? Look at what happens to the women who dare to speak out against or refuse the advances of powerful men. Listen to what\u2019s been said about Eryn Jean Norvill during the course of Rush\u2019s defamation suit. If the Daily Telegraph is guilty of anything, it isn\u2019t the defamation of Rush but the anxiety and tangible damage they\u2019ve invited upon a woman (who did not consent to speaking publicly) now viewed by many as orchestrating his apparent \u201cdemise\u201d. Norvill isn\u2019t the only victim of this backlash. Harvey Weinstein saw to it that the women who scorned him were blacklisted in Hollywood, the already finite window of time allowed to female actors slammed shut in their face because they refused to pay the toll of entry. Mira Sorvino, Annabella Sciorra, Rose McGowan \u2013 these are just some of the names we know whose careers were thwarted by a man who only now, after decades of impunity, has to face the possible consequences of this. And what of the women whose work we\u2019ll never see at all, because abuse, trauma and exploitation derailed their carts before they even made it on to the tracks? The artists, the writers, the orators, the politicians, the thinkers, the musicians \u2013 all the genius undoubtedly lost, because the rights of powerful men to continuing \u201cmaking mistakes\u201d are still held as sacrosanct to integrity of culture? How many women have been either forced out of their industries or chose to leave because the man-made obstacles being placed in their path became too mammoth to scale? Well might Rush fret that his career is over, but history shows the likelihood of that is slim to none. It is infinitely more likely that Norvill will suffer an impact, just as Christie Whelan Browne and Erika Heynatz feared would happen after they both spoke out against Craig McLachlan. There are other names, of course, men (and at least one woman) accused of using their fame as a cloak for their peccadillos. There are even famous men who have admitted their behaviour, although far fewer who\u2019ve made genuine apologies for it. Why would they need to? There are scores of onlookers willing to excuse them, some of them driven by fandom and others simply by the belief that men in possession of power, privilege and station should also be granted an extremely long leash. But still, people whine about how the collective shriek of women\u2019s anger and outrage will impact men\u2019s careers. What will we do without Louis CK?! some people cry. Are we just expected to throw out the works of Picasso now? To never watch the movies of Woody Allen again? Are you seriously expecting us to give up on [GENERIC WHITE MALE WRITER WHO ROUTINELY SCREWS YOUNG WOMEN]?! Can\u2019t we separate the aaaaaaart from the aaaaaaartist? Here\u2019s a radical idea. The world would be fine without Picasso. We will survive without the self-pitying comedy of Louis CK. Woody Allen was over long ago, and there are enough depressed white men writing turgid literature to cover the field. We don\u2019t need to keep lamenting the loss of opportunities for men who squandered the privilege of that position in the first place. We\u2019ve spent too long thinking and worrying about men\u2019s careers. It\u2019s time for us to mourn what has been lost, and see to it that we don\u2019t keep telling that same, boring story over and over again. \u2022 Clementine Ford is an award winning writer and speaker from Melbourne.

Up to eight microchipped beavers will be introduced to Cropton Forest on the North York Moors in the hope that they will build dams to slow down any surges of water from big rainfalls, helping prevent flooding downstream in places such as Pickering. In another project, beavers were introduced this summer to the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire to prevent flooding in the village of Lydbrook, which was badly flooded in November 2012. The rodents build their dams on shallow streams and rivers using small tree trunks, branches, mud and stones. A study recently published by Exeter University found that beavers released at a location in West Devon in 2011 slowed the flow of water, as well as cleaning up polluted water and soil washed off fields further upstream. But there are a lot of myths about beavers. They don\u2019t compete with anglers by eating fish because they are strictly vegetarian, and they don\u2019t devastate their habitats but actually improve wildlife and plant diversity. And beavers are not an alien species to this country \u2013 they were native here for thousands of years before being hunted to extinction about 400 years ago for their fur and scent glands.", "0||Migrant caravan converges on Mexico City after three weeks on the roadThousands of Central American migrants headed towards Mexico City on Monday after three weeks of walking, pleading for rides and depending on the solidarity of Mexicans of modest means. One group of at least 1,000 caravan participants headed out at daybreak from the town of C\u00f3rdoba, in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, hoping to hitchhike the remaining 300km, past the towering Pico de Orizaba \u2013 Mexico\u2019s highest mountain \u2013 to the national capital. They were following in the footsteps of about 500 marchers who reached Mexico City on Sunday night, where the local government has converted a sports complex into a camp for more than 5,000 people. The caravan\u2019s arrival in Mexico City marks an improbable achievement for the ragtag band of impoverished migrants who set out from Central America with little more than hope, dreams and a few scant possessions on an odyssey toward the US border. They have hitchhiked about 1,500km, crossing two international borders \u2013 despite the barrage of warnings from Donald Trump who has thundered against the caravan as a national security threat ahead of US midterm elections on Tuesday. Mexico\u2019s government said on Saturday that around 5,000 migrants were still winding their way through the country in at least three caravans; 2,793 have applied for asylum. \u201cWe left fear behind in Honduras,\u201d said Lester Alvarado, 28, as he trudged along the highway in Veracruz on Monday. He fled Honduras with his wife Belkis S\u00e1nchez, 22 \u2013 leaving their three children with his parents \u2013 after gangsters shot up their restaurant in Tegucigalpa when they failed to pay protection money. The Veracruz governor, Miguel \u00c1ngel Yunes, initially offered 160 buses to take the migrants straight through the state to Mexico City on Friday, telling the newspaper El Universal: \u201cThere are already migrants in Veracruz, begging for money in the streets. It\u2019s a serious social problem and we don\u2019t want it to increase.\u201d But he later reneged on the promise, claiming Mexico City was unprepared to receive so many migrants due to water service cuts \u2013 something denied by city officials. His decision left the migrants stranded in the city of Sayula on Saturday as they woke at 3am and queued for buses that never arrived. \u201cThis cancellation is having the result of fragmenting the caravan, whose unity was its main form of protection,\u201d the UN high commissioner for refugees tweeted on Saturday. The fiasco prompted many of the migrants to push forward to the capital, leaving behind slower-moving family groups with children. How long the caravan stays in Mexico City remains uncertain. The migrants are expected to receive consular assistance and lawyers will advise them on their options for requesting refugee status in either Mexico or the United States. Alvarado said he was not interested in staying in Mexico, which is going through its own security crisis, and last year recorded its highest murder rate since records began.", "4||Corrections and clarifications\u2022 A feature about Armistice Day said about 11,000 soldiers were killed on 11 November 1918.

In a bid to address concerns raised by campaigners, claimants and MPs, the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, announced a raft of changes on Monday to plans governing the transfer of 3 million people on to the new benefit. The so-called \u201cmanaged migration\u201d of universal credit claimants has become a major political concern, with two former prime ministers, John Major and Gordon Brown, joining MPs in warning that mishandling the process could trigger a poll tax-style revolt. Problems with universal credit, especially the long wait for a first benefit payment, have been identified as a key cause of hardship for claimants, with many forced to turn to food banks to survive and tens of thousands running up rent arrears. McVey\u2019s announcement followed a report by the government\u2019s social security advisory committee (SSAC) that warned of \u201csignificant concerns\u201d that the universal credit plans were rushed, too complex and placed too much risk on claimants. MPs will debate the migration regulations in the next few weeks. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has now said it accepts or will look again at 11 of the report\u2019s 12 recommendations for change. McVey told the Commons on Monday: \u201cWe will take a measured approach to delivering managed migration, taking our time to get it right and working with claimants to co-design it.\u201d The DWP has announced a number of measures as part of \u00a31bn package announced in the budget to help claimants\u2019 transition to universal credit, including providing two weeks\u2019 additional benefit to unemployed claimants to help them manage the five-week wait for a first UC payment. The SSAC report followed a consultation in which it received a record 455 responses, including more than 300 from individual claimants or their carers. It noted that it had been \u201cparticularly struck by the degree of anxiety\u201d about managed migration conveyed by this group. Sir Ian Diamond, the SSAC chair, said he was pleased that the government had largely accepted the committee\u2019s advice, but said much detail still had to be worked out. He said he was disappointed that the DWP had rejected a key recommendation to abandon plans to force all existing benefit claimants to make a claim for universal credit before they could be migrated to it. The DWP said making a new claim was essential to ensure all data was up to date. Campaigners, who have lobbied ministers hard to demand changes in recent months, welcomed McVey\u2019s announcement, but said the measures did not go far enough to limit the risk that thousands of vulnerable claimants could be left without benefit income. Frank Field, who chairs the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: \u201d[McVey] could not ignore the swell of expert voices warning that the government\u2019s approach to moving vulnerable people to universal credit could end in disaster and destitution. The department deserves credit for listening, but its response fails to provide in full the necessary safeguards for claimants.\u201d Alison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said there was some good news in the revised regulations, but it was disappointing that the government rejected the argument for moving people on existing benefits over to universal credit automatically. Phillip Anderson, the head of policy at the MS Society, said: \u201cThe stop-start approach to managed migration remains a real concern. The government has said they will provide a one-off sum to help people manage, but this will not be enough. The best and only solution is for claimants to remain on their existing benefits until a universal credit claim is in place.\u201d", "10||May to face cabinet after Varadkar stands firm on Brexit backstopTheresa May is to face her cabinet at a critical point in the Brexit negotiations after the Irish premier told her he could not allow the UK to dictate the terms of any backstop. Amid intense concern over whether it will be possible to agree a deal, the British prime minister will update colleagues after Leo Varadkar rejected the idea that the UK could unilaterally call time on the Irish border backstop, shortly after a morning phone call between the two leaders. May needs to secure the backing of her cabinet on Tuesday over the issue, which No 10 sources indicated was the sole remaining sticking point in Brexit talks that need to be concluded by the end of the month. Varadkar\u2019s office released a statement shortly after May had called him on Monday morning, which said that while Ireland was open to the possibility of \u201ca review mechanism\u201d for the backstop, \u201cthe outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop\u201d. The prime minister rang her opposite number after it emerged that Brexit secretary Dominic Raab had alarmed the Irish last week by demanding in a \u201crobust meeting\u201d with the country\u2019s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, that any backstop last only for three months. In an indication of the febrile atmosphere surrounding the talks, sources close to Raab were forced to respond on Monday to Westminster rumours by saying that the Brexit secretary had no intention of resigning over the duration of the backstop. Prior to speaking to May, Varadkar had warned that a three-month backstop was worthless: \u201cAs a government we\u2019re working very hard to get an agreement, ideally by the end of the year but one thing we can\u2019t countenance is any idea that there\u2019d be a three-month limit on the backstop, a backstop with a three-month limit on it or an expiry date on it of that nature isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\u201d Half an hour after the Irish statement, Downing Street confirmed the call had taken place \u201cto take stock of the progress being made in the negotiations\u201d. But the No 10 statement did not refer to the Irish concerns about unilateralism. A spokesman said the British and Irish leaders had agreed the backstop would be \u201ca temporary arrangement\u201d, and that May had emphasised that there would need to be \u201ca mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end\u201d. A backstop is deemed necessary to ensure there is no return to a hard border in Ireland, if the UK and the EU are unable to secure a long-term free trade deal after the end of the Brexit transition period in 2020. It involves some or all of the UK remaining in the customs union until agreement is reached. However, several cabinet members are concerned that the backstop arrangements could be used by the EU to put pressure on the UK after April when detailed free trade negotiations begin \u2013 and that the Britain could effectively be left in a long-term limbo, still in the customs union without any say in decision-making. It is not clear how far they will voice concerns to May at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. \u201cI think up to half the cabinet have talked about the importance of the UK being able to end the backstop, but I don\u2019t know how many will raise that specifically at the meeting,\u201d one cabinet source said. May promoted two loyal MPs on Tuesday following the resignation of Tracey Crouch as sports minister \u2013 Mims Davies now has that role, and Nigel Adams takes up her old post as Wales minister. No 10 argued the British and Irish statements demonstrated that progress had been made, with the Irish signalling they were willing to discuss a review or mechanism for ending the backstop in principle. But Downing Street would not discuss its details, saying only that the UK was \u201cseeking a mechanism\u201d by which it could be ended. Coveney confirmed that Raab did ask the Irish for a three-month limit on the backstop when they met in London last week. \u201cIt was discussed, it was dismissed and made very clear that it was not a runner,\u201d a spokesman for the foreign minister said, adding that the two men had a \u201crobust discussion.\u201d Raab declined to comment, although the minister has previously made clear that there needs to be finality to any backstop arrangements agreed. EU officials believe there needs to be \u201cdecisive progress\u201d by the weekend for Donald Tusk, the European council president, to be able to announce a summit for the end of November. Without such a development, sources suggested the only viable option would be to leave the deal until the leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels on 13 December. UK officials, however, suggested a summit could be called with a week\u2019s notice, and were indicating that they believed one could be held in the week beginning 26 November, just before May and other leaders fly out on 29 November for the G20 in Argentina. There appears to be a softening on the EU side toward an all-UK customs union, which would replace the idea of a Northern Ireland-specific arrangement that has been repeatedly rejected by May and the UK government. But it would require an acceptance by Downing Street that it would in effect be a permanent arrangement, officials indicated. EU diplomats and officials recognise that the UK wants a breakthrough this week but there is deep scepticism in Brussels that it will be possible to find common ground on the most difficult areas in the next few days. British sources said that talks on the future economic partnership \u2013 the future trade deal \u2013 were as advanced as they could be without resolving the question of the backstop, which was expected to form a key part of the withdrawal agreement, the legally enforceable conditions by which the UK leaves the EU next March. Cabinet members were shown a 15-page-long draft at a meeting two weeks ago, which one person said was sufficiently broadly drafted that it could be interpreted as abandoning the Chequers insistence on the UK signing up to a common rulebook for food and goods that is hated by the Tory right. No 10 denied that Chequers has been dropped.", "2||Your guide to 2018 midterm elections", "10||With the boss annoyed and Labour confused, opportunity NokesBe careful what you wish for. Midway through an urgent question on the government\u2019s policy on EU nationals, the Conservative Rebecca Pow demanded both that freedom of movement should end and that Britain should remain \u201copen to the brightest and the best\u201d. Something that would immediately disqualify both Pow and Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister to whom her question was addressed, from the House of Commons. Not even their closest friends would describe Pow or Nokes as the brightest or the best. Or sentient or barely adequate. In her appearance before the home affairs select committee last week, Nokes managed to make up government policy on the spot by claiming that it would be up to employers to make additional checks on a worker\u2019s status based totally on guesswork. Within hours, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, was forced to make a correction. He had never wanted Nokes as part of his team \u2013 he wasn\u2019t picky, but he did have standards \u2013 and he couldn\u2019t be held responsible for whatever nonsense came out of her mouth. In future it would be best for everyone to ignore whatever she said and come straight to him for clarification. A kinder boss might have taken the hit for a clueless member of staff, but Javid had clearly decided enough was enough. There were limits to his largesse. Nokes had broken it, she could fix it. So even though he was tabled to answer the UQ, he had found himself tied up Googling \u201cSajid + future prime minister\u201d on his work computer, and it was Nokes herself who was left to demonstrate why she had been promoted well beyond her capability. You can understand Javid\u2019s frustration, but it\u2019s not a great look to openly display the paucity of talent on the government\u2019s benches. Even someone as intellectually challenged as Chris Grayling might have worked out that the best plan was to fess up. Apologise for the error, eat humble pie and live to fight another day. But there is so little connection between Nokes\u2019s synapses that she genuinely appeared to have no idea why she had been made to come to the Commons. Far from being contrite, she appeared snappy and disdainful of anyone who dared to ask her a question. An object lesson in passive-aggressive mediocrity. Everything was fine, Nokes declared. What\u2019s more, everything was going to be fine, and if everything turned out not to be fine then the government would definitely have a plan to make it not not fine. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, was unsurprisingly not reassured by this display of uncontrolled ignorance. She wanted confirmation that the information the minister had previously given was incorrect and what the process for determining the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK post-Brexit would be. Computer said no. Nokes was happy to clarify that there was nothing to clarify. The home affairs select committee must have misheard her last week. Her position was the same as it had always been: that there would be no need for employers to make additional checks until such time as the government decided there would be a need for additional checks. But for the time being, take it as read that all EU nationals would be treated as they were now up until June 2021. Now it was Hilary Benn\u2019s turn to be confused. So did this mean that free movement of labour would effectively continue for a minimum of three more years? Absolutely not, Nokes sneered. What bit of the government\u2019s commitment to ending freedom of labour hadn\u2019t he understood? Just because EU nationals were being allowed to stay, it didn\u2019t follow that they were being allowed to stay. She was committed to making settled status as unsettled as possible and the government would be announcing its immigration policy soon. \u201cHow soon was soon?\u201d several MPs asked. Very soon. How soon was very soon? A couple of weeks. Maybe more. Who could possibly say? \u201cSo,\u201d Nokes declared testily, \u201cthe home secretary has promised a white paper in the autumn.\u201d At which point someone observed it was already November. Yeah, but no, but yeah, but she\u2019d never never said which November. It all became very ugly. Labour\u2019s Karen Buck started talking numbers. There were 3.5 million EU nationals in the UK, of whom only 1,000 had been given settled status so far. Nokes defiantly insisted that this illustrated how well advanced her department\u2019s preparations were and at this current rate of progress the backlog would be cleared by 2050. Or earlier if some of the 3.5 million had the grace to die in between. Had the Speaker been feeling kind, he would have brought Nokes\u2019s pain to a close somewhat earlier. But John Bercow had a vested interest in delaying the debate on bullying for as long as possible in the hope that it would get little media attention. So Nokes was forced to suffer. The only consolation was that she was almost certainly too dim to realise just how badly she had humiliated herself.", "11||Morning mail: US networks pull racist ad, Morrison poll slump, single parents punishedGood morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 6 November. Top stories As early voting begins in the US midterm elections, Facebook has joined Fox News, CNN, NBC News and others in refusing to air Donald Trump\u2019s racist anti-immigration campaign ad. The 30-second anti-immigration advert, paid for by the Donald Trump for President campaign, was tweeted out by the president last week and aired during an NFL game on NBC on Sunday night and on Fox News. CNN previously had declined to run the advert, which it described as \u201cracist\u201d. Asked about organisations pulling his advert on Monday, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t know about it \u2026 we have a lot of ads \u2026 a lot of things are offensive.\u201d Trump also claimed in a tweet there would be \u201cMaximum Criminal Penalties\u201d for \u201cILLEGAL VOTING\u201d, in what critics called a naked attempt to scare voters from the polls. There have already been complaints about malfunctioning voting machines in Texas and Georgia, where the Democrat Stacey Abrams has condemned her opponent in the governor\u2019s race, Brian Kemp, as abusing his power. Kemp announced an unexplained investigation into alleged \u201ccybercrime\u201d by the state Democratic party. We will have live coverage as all the results come in throughout Wednesday (Australian time). In the meantime here is everything you need to know about the midterms. Single parents in Australia have been told they must attend events such as \u201cstory time\u201d with their child or lose their welfare payments under a new government program, Parents Next. More than 60, 000 parents have been placed on the program after receiving a call from Centrelink assessing whether they are at risk of \u201clong-term welfare dependency\u201d. Since July, these parents \u2013 overwhelmingly single women \u2013 must meet a fortnightly participation plan negotiated with a case worker. If they don\u2019t, their parenting payment \u2013 $384.25 for a single person \u2013 can be suspended or terminated. Parents say they have been forced by their providers to attend activities such as swimming lessons or playgroups, or told to sign up to education courses at their own expense, even if they already hold qualifications. Dozens of pupils have been kidnapped from a boarding school in Cameroon, in an attack reminiscent of Boko Haram\u2019s 2014 abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria. Suspected secessionists arrived at Presbyterian secondary school Nkwen in Bamenda, the capital of the English-speaking north-west region, on Sunday night. They kidnapped the principal, a teacher and a driver, as well as 79 students, according to the regional administrator. Labor has pulled further in front of the Coalition as voter disapproval of Scott Morrison jumps nine points in a month, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The survey put Labor ahead of the Coalition 54% to 46% on the two-party-preferred measure, compared with 53% to 47% a fortnight ago. Morrison\u2019s net approval rating has been in positive territory since he took the Liberal leadership, but the result this fortnight means the prime minister\u2019s rating has slipped from +15 to +4. Sperm whales have been sighted in the Arctic, which scientists have interpreted as a sign of a changing ecosystem.

Continuing an approach established in recent weeks, the president used campaign rallies, his Twitter account and press interviews to warn of an \u201cinvasion\u201d by a caravan of migrants approaching the southern border, and of the supposed threat posed by \u201cleftwing mobs\u201d. It was an effort to energize his conservative base in the final days of an election season roiled by fear, division and racial anxiety which reportedly left the House speaker, Paul Ryan, pleading with Trump to focus on the roaring economy instead. According to the website Politico, the president demurred. Trump\u2019s presidency may be at stake. If Democrats reclaim the House, as they are favored to do and party leadership has said it expects, they will be empowered to thwart his agenda. If Republicans maintain control of the House as well as the Senate, their expected prize, they could be emboldened to press home Trump\u2019s policies. As Barack Obama delivered his own closing arguments against Trump \u2013 telling Democrats in Virginia \u201cthe character of this country is on the ballot, who we are is on the ballot\u201d \u2013 the president spent Monday morning tweeting endorsements of Republicans, before moving on to rallies in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri. He also reprised his baseless claim of widespread voter fraud. \u201cLaw Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday\u2019s Election (or Early Voting),\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cAnyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law. Thank you!\u201d The issue has flared up in Georgia, where the secretary of state, Brian Kemp, who is also the Republican gubernatorial candidate, oversaw a purge of more than half a million voters from the state\u2019s rolls. Democrats and civil rights groups have called this voter suppression in one of the most closely watched governor\u2019s races. Kemp has denied the charge. Over the weekend, Kemp announced an unexplained investigation into alleged \u201ccybercrime\u201d by the Georgia Democratic party. The Democratic candidate for governor, Stacey Abrams, said on Monday her opponent had \u201cabused his power\u201d. If elected, Abrams would be the first non-white, non-male governor of Georgia and the first female African American governor in US history. The justice department announced it would send personnel to 35 jurisdictions in 19 states to \u201cmonitor compliance with the federal voting rights laws\u201d. Across the US, campaigns were making their final pitches amid reports of sky-high enthusiasm and record turnout among early voters. According to new polling from NextGen America, a liberal advocacy group led by the billionaire Tom Steyer, youth turnout in the midterms is expected to surge. Turnout among 18- to 35-year-olds traditionally lags behind other age groups, a gap that grows wider during midterms. But data shared with the Guardian suggested this year may be different. Among such voters in six key states, 37% said they would definitely vote or had already voted. In the 2014 midterms, only 23% voted. The data indicated that such voters lean heavily Democratic, preferring a Democrat to a Republican on a generic ballot by 59% to 33%. Trump has made the midterms a referendum on his presidency. Though he has happily claimed credit for the humming economy and positive employment figures, he has forced immigration, race and nationalism to the fore. At a campaign rally last month, he declared himself a \u201cnationalist\u201d. On Monday he also returned to another familiar target: the media. In a tweet, Trump appeared to make the argument that public opinion polling, which has consistently forecast a Democratic takeover in the House, was intended to suppress Republican turnout. \u201cSo funny to see the CNN Fake Suppression Polls and false rhetoric\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWatch for real results Tuesday. We are lucky CNN\u2019s ratings are so low. Don\u2019t fall for the Suppression Game. Go out &amp; VOTE. Remember, we now have perhaps the greatest Economy (JOBS) in the history of our Country!\u201d However, most such polling predicted Trump would lose the presidency to Hillary Clinton in 2016, only for a string of wins in post-industrial, rust belt states to hand him the White House via the electoral college. On Monday, Trump was scheduled to travel back to some such areas. He would fly to Cleveland, to campaign for Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike DeWine. He was then due in Fort Wayne, Indiana, to campaign for the Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun, who is trying to unseat Democrat Joe Donnelly. Trump was to end the day in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, with a rally for Republican Josh Hawley, the state attorney general who is mounting a strong challenge to the Democratic senator Claire McCaskill. As Trump prepared to leave Washington, the weather turned against him. The president was grounded, forced to travel from the White House to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland by motorcade, instead of flying high on Marine One.", "9||Ozone layer finally healing after damage caused by aerosols, UN saysThe ozone layer is showing signs of continuing recovery from man-made damage and is likely to heal fully by 2060, new evidence shows. The measures taken to repair the damage will also have an important beneficial effect on climate change, as some of the gases that caused the ozone layer to thin and in places disappear also contribute to warming the atmosphere. Phasing them out could avoid as much as 0.5C (0.9F) of warming this century. Recovery from the holes and thinning caused by aerosol chemicals has progressed at a rate of about 1% to 3% a decade since 2000, meaning the ozone layer over the northern hemisphere and mid-latitudes should heal completely by the 2030s, if current rates are sustained. Over the southern hemisphere and in the more problematic polar regions, recovery will take longer, until the middle of this century in the former and about 2060 in the latter case. The results, presented on Monday in a four-year assessment of the health of the ozone layer, represent a rare instance of global environmental damage being repaired, and a victory for concerted global action by governments. Scientific evidence of the depletion of the ozone layer over the Antarctic was first presented in 1985, and in 1987 the Montreal protocol was signed, binding world governments to reduce and phase out the harmful chemicals identified as causing the problem. Ozone in the upper layers of the atmosphere protects the earth\u2019s surface from most of the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. Without it, skin and eye damage can occur, and evidence suggests a rise in skin cancers associated with the thinning of the ozone layer. \u201cThe Montreal protocol is one of the most successful multilateral agreements in history for a reason,\u201d said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. \u201cThe careful mix of authoritative science and collaborative action that has defined the protocol for more than 30 years and was set to heal our ozone layer is precisely why the Kigali amendment holds such promise for climate action in future.\u201d The Kigali amendment to the Montreal protocol, coming into effect at the start of next year, will help reduce future climate change, by targeting HFC gases, mostly used in refrigeration, which have a warming effect tens of thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide. Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: \u201cOver the last three decades, the Montreal protocol has fulfilled its original objective to heal the ozone layer. But it didn\u2019t stop there. Because CFCs and related gases are also super climate pollutants, phasing them out has reduced the climate problem by an amount that would have equalled the contribution of carbon dioxide today \u2013 more than half of all warming \u2013 with the Kigali amendment adding even more climate protection.\u201d Until recently, most major sources of ozone-harming gases were thought to have been closed down, until studies showed sites in China where gases were still emerging. The Chinese government has pledged to find and close down these sites.", "12||Make social media firms remove terror attack images, says police chiefThe police officer who led the response to the Manchester Arena bombing last year has said Twitter and Facebook should be required to remove terrorist attack images and videos that could distress victims\u2019 families. Ian Hopkins, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said while most newspapers abided by the voluntary editors\u2019 code of practice that restricts the publication of material that intrudes on relatives\u2019 grief, there is no equivalent for social media companies, which set their own rules. Speaking at the Society of Editors annual conference in Salford, he said he was \u201c100%\u201d in favour of rules that would force social media sites to take down intrusive material down \u201cvery quickly\u201d if the police asked. The proposal was also backed by the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. \u201cThe time has come for a much stronger code that applies right across the board,\u201d he said. The editors\u2019 code of practice that covers issues around grief is administered by the press regulator Ipso. The Guardian, which is not regulated by Ipso, also recommends its journalists follow similar guidelines. Hopkins praised much of the reporting in the aftermath of the Manchester attack, in which 22 people were killed and more than 100 injured, as \u201csupportive, constructive, considered\u201d, especially by local newspapers such as the Manchester Evening News. But he was critical of how some news organisations treated families of victims when they were grieving and \u201cincapable of making rational, informed decisions\u201d. \u201cIt was awful to hear some of those stories,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cFinding out from journalists that members of extended families had been killed, being met by journalists at airports, being besieged on social media, money being offered to medical staff in hospitals.\u201d There was particular criticism for the New York Times\u2019 decision to publish leaked images of the devices used in the bombing, which had been shared with US security services by their British equivalents. Hopkins also said he was exasperated after the far-right activist Tommy Robinson used the attack to post pictures of the police chief being gifted a copy of the Qur\u2019an, claiming it had happened in the aftermath of the incident. In reality, the picture had been taken a year earlier. Hopkins previously criticised the BBC\u2019s decision to show a critically lauded documentary recreating the night of the attack on an Ariana Grande concert at the arena, which featured footage of the aftermath of the bombing. The BBC insisted the broadcast was justified. The independent Kerslake review, which looked at the circumstances surrounding the attack, unexpectedly expanded its remit to cover the role of the media following criticism from families.", "11||Labor pulls further in front of Coalition as Morrison's disapproval rating risesLabor has pulled further in front of the Coalition in the national political contest, and voter disapproval of Scott Morrison has jumped by nine points in a month, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The latest survey of 1,028 voters puts Labor ahead of the Coalition 54% to 46% on the two-party-preferred measure, compared with 53% to 47% a fortnight ago \u2013 a result that would give Bill Shorten an easy election win. More voters (41%) approve of Morrison\u2019s performance as prime minister than disapprove (37%), but disapproval has risen from 28% in October, a shift outside the poll\u2019s margin of error which is plus or minus 3%. Morrison\u2019s net approval rating has been in positive territory since he took the Liberal leadership in bitterly contested circumstances, suggesting voters have been willing to indulge his opening pitch, but the result this fortnight means the prime minister\u2019s rating has slipped from +15 to +4. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has recorded a five-point increase in his approval rating over the month (33% to 38%) and his disapproval is down one point to 44%. Shorten\u2019s net approval rating remains in negative territory, but there has been an improvement from -12 to -6. Morrison remains ahead of Shorten as preferred prime minister 41% to 29%, a similar result to a month ago, where Morrison was ahead 42% to 27%. The bad portents in the new poll follow several scrappy weeks for Morrison and the government. A series of leaks, stumbles and controversies culminated in the loss of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s former seat of Wentworth in late October \u2013 a development that has cost the government its majority in the House of Representatives and emboldened the cross bench. The Australian Electoral Commission on Monday declared the high-profile independent Kerryn Phelps the winner of the Wentworth contest with a margin of 1,851 votes or 1.2% in two-party-preferred terms after a record 19% swing against the Liberal party. Ahead of the resumption of parliament for the final sitting weeks before the summer break, Morrison has hit the road, embarking on a campaign dry run in Queensland this week, swinging through several marginal seats critical to the outcome of the next federal election. The government is hopeful about its electoral prospects in Queensland, a state where Turnbull was considered unpopular, and Morrison is spending a lot of time projecting what his strategists consider to be a relatable persona, with frequent social media posts heavy on vernacular. But Shorten and Labor have already done considerable groundwork in Queensland during this term in opposition. The Labor leader has visited Queensland 47 times since the last federal election, concentrating on regional seats. Labor is already distributing new campaign materials in Queensland highlighting Morrison\u2019s record as treasurer, and emphasising the leadership instability in the Liberal party. As he attempts to win over Queensland voters, Morrison, who clashed with Turnbull last week, will also have to deal with the first major television interview from his predecessor since the conservative-led leadership coup in August. Turnbull is due to appear solo on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Thursday evening. Voters in the Guardian Essential sample this fortnight were asked about coal-fired power, support for the royal family and a republic in the wake of the recent tour by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and about horse racing, with the Melbourne Cup on Tuesday. Voters were split about whether the government should provide support to new coal-fired power stations, including indemnifying them against the risk of a future carbon price, an idea floated by the energy minister, Angus Taylor \u2013 39% approved of the idea and 35% disapproved. A majority of Coalition voters approved (58%) while 65% of Greens voters disapproved. Labor voters were split, with 33% approving and 40% disapproving. More voters want a republic than oppose that change (44% to 32%), with young people more supportive than voters over 55. There has been a 4% drop in support for a republic since the question was last put in May. Perceptions of Queen Elizabeth, Prince William and Prince Harry are highly favourable, with 70% having a positive opinion of Prince Harry, 68% of Prince William and 61% of Queen Elizabeth. Prince Charles \u2013 the heir to the throne \u2013 is less popular, with only 33% having a favourable view. On horse racing, 8% profess high interest in the sport and 20% have a moderate interest, with 70% say they have low or no interest. Despite only 19% of the sample reporting they regularly bet on horse races, 38% said they would be watching the Melbourne Cup on Tuesday and placing a bet, and 33% say they would be watching the event but not placing a bet. One in three said they had never been interested in the Melbourne Cup, with 26% saying they had become less interested because of concerns about problem gambling and 29% reporting they had become less interested because of concerns about animal welfare.", "2||Fox News, NBC and Facebook pull Trump ad widely condemned as racistFox News, NBC and Facebook have pulled a Donald Trump campaign advert that has been widely condemned as racist. The 30 second anti-immigration advert, paid for by the Donald Trump for President campaign, was tweeted out by the president last week and aired during an NFL game on NBC on Sunday night and on Fox News. CNN previously had declined to run the advert, which it described as \u201cracist\u201d. The ad appears to be an attempt to tie the caravan of migrants and refugees seeking asylum in the US to Luis Bracamontes, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who shot and killed two sheriff\u2019s deputies in 2014. Asked about organizations pulling his advert on Monday, Trump claimed: \u201cI don\u2019t know about it \u2026 we have a lot of ads \u2026 a lot of things are offensive.\u201d \u201cAfter further review we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible,\u201d said an NBC spokesman, Joe Benarroch. Fox News said it would also stop playing the ad. \u201cUpon further review, Fox News pulled the ad yesterday and it will not appear on either Fox News Channel or Fox Business Network,\u201d Marianne Gambelli, Fox News\u2019s president of advertisement sales, told CNN on Monday. The advert features ominous-sounding music as a voice warns urgently about \u201cthe 7,000-migrant caravan\u201d that it said was \u201cmarching toward our border\u201d. It adds: \u201cDangerous illegal criminals like cop-killer Luis Bracamontes don\u2019t care about our laws\u201d, before urging people to \u201cvote Republican\u201d. It ends with Donald Trump saying: \u201cI approve this message.\u201d On Monday Facebook said it had blocked the advert from receiving \u201cpaid promotion\u201d. \u201cThis ad violates Facebook\u2019s advertising policy against sensational content so we are rejecting it,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWhile the video is allowed to be posted on Facebook, it cannot receive paid distribution.\u201d On Saturday, after Donald Trump Jr complained on Twitter that CNN had refused to run the advert, CNN replied saying the commercial was \u201cracist\u201d. \u201cCNN has made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist. When presented with an opportunity to be paid to take a version of this ad, we declined. Those are the facts,\u201d the network\u2019s communication department tweeted.", "13||Stansted protesters believed deportees were at risk of death, court toldFifteen people on trial for blocking the takeoff of an immigration removal charter flight from Stansted were acting to protect the human rights of passengers who were at risk of persecution, torture, serious injury or death if they were deported, a court has heard. At the opening of their defence at Chelmsford crown court on Monday, the defendants began making the case that they had acted out of conscience to protect those on the flight not just from persecution in their destination countries, but also from abuse of process in the UK. All 15 are on trial for endangering the safety of an aerodrome by chaining themselves together around a Titan Airways flight chartered by the Home Office to remove 60 people to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. If convicted, the maximum possible sentence is life in prison. The court heard they were arrested on 28 March 2017, the day after they walked on to the apron at Stansted, after police spent several hours cutting them free from \u201clock-on\u201d devices they used to secure themselves around the plane. The first of the defendants to give evidence, Benjamin Smoke, 27, told the court he had concerns that \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policies were leading to the deportation of people who ought to be given asylum to protect their human rights. Smoke, a freelance journalist and founding member of campaign group Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants, said he had particular concerns about the safety of deportees who had sought to claim asylum because of their sexuality. He said he and his co-defendants had learned of the stories of passengers from the Detained Voices blog, which publishes statements from people caught in the UK\u2019s immigration removal process. \u201cOne of them was a woman from Nigeria who \u2026 said that she had escaped Nigeria after being in an abusive marriage. She had escaped her abusive ex-husband, her children were living with her sister, [and] she had come to the UK where she was living openly as a lesbian,\u201d Smoke told the court. \u201cShe had put in a claim for asylum on the grounds of her sexuality. It had been refused by the Home Office; she had put in an appeal and she was still waiting for the outcome of that appeal. \u201cShe said that her ex-husband had called her and said something along the lines of: \u2018We know you are coming and we are going to kill you when you get here.\u2019\u201d Asked why he carried out the direct action, Smoke replied: \u201cBecause \u2026 it was clear that there were people in genuine peril and I felt compelled [to act] and like it was necessary to do something to stop their deaths.\u201d The prosecution sought to show the activists placed the airport, its staff and passengers at risk. But in his testimony, Smoke said safety had been \u201cintegral to every single discussion that had been going on at the time\u201d. \u201cWe were concerned with everyone\u2019s safety; the safety of us, the safety of people due to be deported, the safety of those around the plane,\u201d he told the court. Safety measures taken by the group included wearing bright-coloured clothing \u201cto make it clear \u2026 who we were\u201d, and carrying low-voltage lights \u201cand a big pink banner on the tripod [that they erected behind one of the wings] to make it clear where we were\u201d. In cross-examination, Tony Badenoch QC, for the prosecution, led Smoke to agree with a series of statements about the rule of law and airport safety. Some supporters in the public gallery stifled a giggle when Badenoch said: \u201cIf we all chose our own laws, that would be the world of anarchy, would it not?\u201d Smoke replied: \u201cYes, it would.\u201d His cross-examination continues tomorrow. Earlier, the court heard that in statements made after their arrests, the activists told the police they believed the removals were being carried out unlawfully, and that they acted \u201cin a reasonable and proportionate way\u201d to prevent harm coming to those onboard. Joseph McGahan said he felt anguished after consulting an immigration lawyer who told him many of the people on the flight would have had open applications for asylum or be in the process of appeal. \u201cMy anguish was compounded by their view that this malpractice is currently common and official attempts to restrict it are very often futile, even for professionals,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cHence I concluded that peacefully intercepting and blocking the flight was the only reasonable course of action for an unprofessional person such as myself, and believe that action was proportionate to the threat that was posed.\u201d On Monday morning, more than 100 supporters of the defendants gathered outside the court. Speakers including former immigration detainees and relatives of the defendants said they believed the defendants were exercising their democratic rights to protest against an unjust immigration regime. The actor Vanessa Redgrave was also present inside the court to show her support for the protesters. In addition to Smoke and McGahan, May McKeith, Nicholas Sigsworth, Helen Brewer, Lyndsay Burtonshaw, Nathan Clack, Laura Clayson, Mel Evans, Jyotsna Ram, Alistair Temlit, Edward Thacker, Emma Hughes, Ruth Potts and Melanie Stickland are also charged with intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome under the 1990 Aviation and Maritime Security Act, a law passed in response to the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. The defendants, aged 27 to 44, have all pleaded not guilty. The trial is expected to last two more weeks.", "5||Give tax breaks to more diverse production firms, say actorsProduction companies should be given tax relief to encourage them to employ more women, disabled people and people from minority ethnic backgrounds, according to a host of prominent figures in show business and other areas of pubic life. The actors Lenny Henry, Thandie Newton and Chiwetel Ejiofor were among the signatories to a letter to the Guardian that said similar moves had been successful before and should be tried again. \u201cTrue representation of the diversity of the UK isn\u2019t just about what we see on our screens, but also the people writing, directing, filming and working behind the camera,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOver the years, some of the most important British films and television have been written and directed by Britain\u2019s talented female, BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] and disabled creatives \u2026 They enrich the creativity of the UK and add to our cultural heritage, but unfortunately they continue to be the exception rather than the rule.\u201d The letter was signed by 80 people, who also included the actor and playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah, the actor Sharon Horgan, and the campaigner Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was murdered in an unprovoked racist attack in 1993. Also putting their names to the letter were the Paralympic athlete and television presenter Ade Adepitan, the playwright Lucy Prebble and Jodie Whittaker, the first female actor to play Doctor Who. They said \u201crepresentation tax relief\u201d was necessary because the UK film and television industry found itself in a \u201ccrisis\u201d in terms of the inclusion of women, disabled people and those from BAME backgrounds, with research showing these groups are still underrepresented behind the camera. In order to address this, they suggested giving tax relief to productions that meet three of the four following criteria: having the director, photography director or writer from one of these groups, and/or those from underrepresented backgrounds making up more than half the people behind the camera.", "6||Mauricio Pochettino looks to House of Cards for tips on life at TottenhamIt has been a tortuous wait for Mauricio Pochettino, scarred by delays and problems with personnel but, at last, it has been delivered. The Tottenham manager could barely disguise his delight. Finally he has been able to binge on House of Cards season six. Pochettino loves the US presidential drama. The Netflix show features intrigue, deceit, ruthlessness and broken promises, with a fair few PR disasters thrown in. How could Pochettino possibly relate to that? \u201cIt\u2019s similar, eh?\u201d Pochettino said with a smile, when asked whether House of Cards mirrored life at Spurs, where the new stadium project has become an all-consuming sideshow. \u201cIt represents very well sometimes how we are. Football is so political and it\u2019s going in this direction. It\u2019s fiction but you can translate it in many businesses \u2013 [things] that happen. \u201cWe\u2019re having a weird season but I look so happy because I\u2019ve started the new season of House of Cards. I watched three episodes on Monday. I\u2019ve learned a lot from this series. I recommend it.\u201d Pochettino has been bogged down by problems since the beginning of pre-season, with many of them linked to the delays in moving back to the rebuilt ground on the site of White Hart Lane. It is strange to think the club maintained for the whole of last season that the stadium would be ready in August. It will now be mid-January at the earliest. Spurs face PSV Eindhoven at Wembley on Tuesday night in an important Champions League Group B tie and it is vexing the pitch is in such poor condition, although Pochettino said it looked better than it did against Manchester City last Monday. Pochettino was reminded of the advertising slogan the club used at the start of the season. They had boasted the new ground would be \u201cthe only place to watch Champions League in London\u201d \u2013 a dig at their rivals Arsenal and Chelsea, who reached only the Europa League. Spurs know that, in all probability, they will have to beat PSV and Internazionale at Wembley and then Barcelona at the Camp Nou to keep their Champions League campaign alive. \u201cWe\u2019re all disappointed that we\u2019re not playing Champions League in the new stadium but it wasn\u2019t in our hands to deliver it,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWhen you build a house or an extension, it\u2019s always difficult to say when it will be finished. We\u2019ve had problems and it\u2019s been delayed, delayed, delayed. \u201cWe feel sorry and pain for our fans, and for ourselves, too. Every day that goes on it\u2019s more expensive for the club but the person who is most worried and sorry is the chairman [Daniel Levy]. It\u2019s so painful for him. All we can do is help by winning games. If we can win against PSV and have the possibility of going to the next stage, then maybe we can play in March in the Champions League in London.\u201d It was noticeable Pochettino did not say \u201cin the new stadium\u201d. He had previously expressed the belief the club would be in situ by Christmas time. He is no longer making any predictions. Pochettino\u2019s squad have been sapped by a gruelling run of fixtures \u2013 the PSV game will be their fourth in nine days \u2013 and the injuries have mounted. Pochettino said he was down to \u201c18, 19 players\u201d, with the problems most pronounced in midfield where Eric Dier, Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Victor Wanyama are out. Jan Vertonghen and Danny Rose are also injured. Hugo Lloris is suspended. Dele Alli, who returned last week from hamstring trouble, is not 100%. Pochettino reported Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who injured an ankle at Wolves on Saturday, had avoided bone damage but may have a problem with the ligament. \u201cWe will know better after the scan,\u201d Pochettino said. Wanyama got a knock at West Ham in the Carabao Cup last Wednesday to his good knee rather than the bad one. He trained on Monday and could be available at Crystal Palace on Saturday.", "14||Lloyds Banking Group to add 2,000 jobs in digital shake-upLloyds Banking Group is planning a major restructuring of its workforce, adding 2,000 jobs as it refocuses its operations on digital technology. Britain\u2019s biggest high street lender will cut 6,000 jobs but create another 8,000 as part of a \u00a33bn reorganisation over the course of the next two years. The job losses will be spread across the group transformation division, corporate banking, retail and community banking, Sky News reported. New roles will be oriented towards digital technology. It is understood that existing Lloyds employees whose jobs disappear will be offered the chance to apply for the new roles, fitting in with an existing re-training drive. Lloyds\u2019 recognised unions, Unite and Accord, have been consulted on the plans, which are not thought to include branch closures at this point, although job losses may be concentrated in specific offices. A Unite spokesperson said: \u201cUnite will scrutinise the detail of the announcement when it is made. Our priority will be to press the company to ensure there are no compulsory redundancies.\u201d Lloyds, which owns brands such as Halifax and Bank of Scotland, announced in February it would re-evaluate its strategy alongside a \u00a33bn investment plan running from 2018 to 2020. At the same time, it is aiming to cut operating costs to less than \u00a38bn in 2020, from \u00a38.2bn in 2017. The UK\u2019s major high street banks have been gradually reducing branch numbers as they adjust to the rapid rise of mobile and online banking and the consequent slump in the number of branch transactions. Lloyds announced 15 branch closures in September, although job losses were not significant. However, it has cut thousands of jobs under the leadership of the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio, who joined the bank in 2011. The bank previously said its \u201ctransformation\u201d programme would affect more than two-thirds of the business. The restructuring plan came after the government sold off its final shares in the bank. Lloyds was bailed out by the government during the financial crisis, following the acquisition of HBOS which made it into the UK\u2019s largest high street bank. Lloyds Banking Group declined to comment.", "13||Prince Charles says Britain's role in slave trade was an atrocityBritain\u2019s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade was an appalling atrocity that has left an \u201cindelible stain\u201d on the world, Prince Charles has acknowledged. The heir to the UK\u2019s throne made the comments in a speech in Ghana, from where many Africans were shipped away to a life of slavery, most across the Atlantic, on ships from Britain and other nations. Charles said the \u201cprofound injustice\u201d of that legacy could never be forgotten, adding: \u201cAt Osu Castle on Saturday, it was especially important to me, as indeed it was on my first visit there 41 years ago, that I should acknowledge the most painful chapter of Ghana\u2019s relations with the nations of Europe, including the United Kingdom. \u201cThe appalling atrocity of the slave trade, and the unimaginable suffering it caused, left an indelible stain on the history of our world.\u201d Charles had visited Christiansborg Castle in Osu, which originally operated as a Danish slave trade fort and from where it is estimated more than 1.5 million Africans were forced into slavery. The castle later became the seat of the Ghanaian government after the country\u2019s independence from Britain in 1957. Britain had been involved in the transatlantic slave trade for more than 200 years by the time it abolished the trade in 1807, although the full abolition of slavery did not follow for another generation. The British taxpayer paid out large sums in compensation to former slave owners, though none was handed to the people who had been enslaved. Many of them were even forced to work on for years without pay after slavery. \u201cWhile Britain can be proud that it later led the way in the abolition of this shameful trade, we have a shared responsibility to ensure that the abject horror of slavery is never forgotten,\u201d Charles told his audience in Ghana. Charles\u2019 intervention was a significant step towards officially acknowledging the damage the UK helped to cause during the period, with the royal family having faced repeated calls from some quarters to apologise for the country\u2019s part in it. The prince and his wife, Camilla, are on the second leg of a tour of three African nations, having already visited Gambia, which he congratulated for turning its back on autocratic rule and returning to the Commonwealth, before he heads to Nigeria on Tuesday. In his speech in Accra, Charles, who was approved as successor to his 92-year-old mother, Queen Elizabeth, as head of the Commonwealth earlier this year, spoke of the role the loose alliance of 53 member states could play in tackling climate change, a key campaigning issue of the prince. \u201cIn such an uncertain and changing world, none of us can know what kind of a planet our grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, will inhabit, but the Commonwealth ... offers us a vital mechanism to help ensure that it is not poisoned and polluted and that its vitality is not compromised,\u201d he said. They will conclude their tour a week before Charles celebrates his 70th birthday on 14 November.", "10||UK won't be seen as 'reliable partner' for trade if it refuses to pay EU after no deal Brexit, Hammond says - Politics livePhilip Hammond, the chancellor, has said that if the UK were to follow the advice of some Brexiters and refuse to pay anything to the EU in the event of a no deal Brexit, it would not be seen as a reliable partner for international trade. (See 6.46pm.) In a long appearance before the Commons Treasury committee, he also said MPs would get \u201cadequate time\u201d to consider the Brexit deal (see 4.43pm), suggested that spending commitments in the budget could get abandoned in a future budget in the event of a no deal Brexit, despite Number 10 saying that would not happen (see 6.16pm) and faced criticism for prioritising jobs in the gambling industry over the lives of addicts by delaying a cut in maximum stakes on fixed odds betting terminals. The immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, has confirmed that employers will not have to make any additional checks on EU nationals to determine whether they have the right to work in the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit. A lottery-style system could be used to allocate scarce haulage permits in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a Department for Transport paper has revealed. Ireland\u2019s prime minister has told Theresa May in a hastily arranged phone call that he cannot allow the UK to unilaterally decide when to terminate the Irish backstop, creating the possibility that Britain could be in a customs union with the EU for the long term. That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for the comments. This is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. Hammond refuses to deny that he would prefer the UK to stay in the customs union. This is not hugely surprising, because Hammond voted remain and it is probably true that his real preference would be for the UK to stay in the EU altogether. Philip Hammond told the committee earlier that, if the UK refused to pay anything to the EU in the event of a no deal Brexit - an option proposed by some Brexiters - it would not be seen as a reliable partner in future trade deals. He told the committee: What I can share with you is the advice from Treasury legal counsel. To the extent that we are in the settlement provisionally agreed, subject to everything being agreed with the European Union, we are making good on commitments that have been entered into with the EU\u2019s acquiescence during our period of membership of the European Union. These are obligations that we entered into and they are obligations that will be due in any case. What we have done in the negotiation is reached agreement on a formula for determining a number post-exit which has been agreed by the UK in the context of a deal. And we would not necessarily be prepared to agree that same formula in the context of no deal. But it would not be plausible or credible for the UK to assert that in the case of no deal, then no money at all was payable in respect of these obligations that were entered into during our period of membership. If we were to do so, we would effectively rule ourselves out as being regarded as reliable partners in future international deals of any kind, including trade deals. Hammond is now having a row with the committee about how long the session is going on for. He says he was told he would be here for two hours. Nicky Morgan, the chair, says she did not agree a time limit. She says it is important for democracy that he answers questions from the committee. Hammond says he will stay until the questions are finished, but this will colour his view when invited to appear again, he says. Q: In Scotland split benefit payments are available. Why are they not available in the UK? Hammond says that is a matter for the DWP. Q: Will the benefit freeze continue? Hammond says the benefit changes announced under George Osborne will continue. The Conservatives said in their 2017 manifesto that they would not revisit them. Q: Can you remember what child benefit was in 2010? No, says Hammond. McGovern says it was \u00a320.30. Now it is \u00a320.70. That is a real terms reduction. Hammond says, once the benefit freeze is over, benefits will start going up again. He says the benefit freeze is a one-off correction of a gross distortion of spending introduced by the last Labour government. Welfare spending rose in a way that was unsustainable. Q: So you are happy with the forecast increase in child poverty? No, says Hammond. Nobody wants that. He says the number of children in absolute poverty is falling. Labour\u2019s Alison McGovern goes next. Q: Why did you implement the tax cuts a year earlier than promised in the Tory manifesto? Hammond says he was adopting a balanced approach. Q: Those who will gain the most are the top 10%. Are they your priority? Now, they are not, he says. He says by 2023-24, the end of the forecast period, the amount being spend on income tax cuts is almost exactly the same as the amount being spent making universal credit more generous. Hammond says it would not be \u201cplausible or credible\u201d for the UK to refuse to pay any money to the EU if it were to leave without a deal. But the government would want to revise the amount it would be willing to pay, he says. The deal agreed as part of the December agreement would no longer stand. Q: Shouldn\u2019t you be threatening to pay nothing? A lords committee said the UK would not have to pay anything. You should use your leverage. Hammond says the UK would have some leverage, in terms of when money was paid. A lump sum is of limited use to the EU. It wants a flow of money. By threatening not to pay in instalments, the UK would have leverage, he says. Q: If there is a no deal Brexit, will all the budget spending commitments be honoured? Hammond says the NHS spending commitment was made before the budget. He says, if there was a shock to the economy, the Treasury would have to respond. Q: So would those commitments be made? Hammond says the budget was made on the back of the forecasts. If the forecasts were to change, the government of the day would have to respond. There would be many ways in which it could respond. Hammond suggests that, if there is no Brexit deal, spending commitments made in this year\u2019s budget could be abandoned. Q: No 10 said all these promises would be honoured, irrespective of whether or not there is a deal. That is not what you are saying. Hammond does not accept there is an inconsistency. He says, if there is no deal, the government of the day would have to respond. Q: If there is no deal, will the economy slow down? Hammond says most forecaster think that. Here is the start of the Press Association story about Hammond\u2019s evidence to the Treasury committee. Chancellor Philip Hammond has denied abandoning his target of eliminating the UK\u2019s deficit by the middle of the next decade. Following his giveaway budget last week, experts said any suggestion the chancellor still intended to meet his fiscal objective of reaching surplus by the mid-2020s was \u201cfor the birds\u201d. But he told the House of Commons Treasury committee that the goal of balancing the nation\u2019s books was \u201cwithin touching distance\u201d, with the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasting the deficit will be trimmed to 0.8% of GDP by 2023/24. Rather than making reducing the deficit the overriding goal of economic policy, it would be a matter for the chancellor at each budget over the next few years to strike a balance between getting borrowing down and other priorities like cutting taxes, increasing public spending and investing in the national infrastructure, he suggested. Hammond\u2019s third budget included increased spending totalling around 100 billion, in what was seen by many observers as a mark that the age of austerity was coming to a close. The director of respected economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, said: \u201cAny idea that there is a serious desire to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s is surely for the birds.\u201d But Hammond denied he had given up his target, set in autumn 2016, to reach a budget surplus \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been abandoned,\u201d he told the cross-party committee. \u201cI have said since the autumn of 2016 that I would take a balanced approach.\u201d This involved \u201crecognising the need to reduce and ultimately eliminate the deficit in order to get debt falling sustainably - something we have now achieved - but also the need to support our public services, keep taxes low and, crucially, to invest in infrastructure, skills, training, research and development and support the future productivity of our country\u201d, he said. \u201cThat is the only way we are going to get sustainable real growth in incomes and rising living standards over the medium term.\u201d OBR forecasts showed the deficit dropping from almost 10% of GDP after the 2008 financial crisis to 0.8% in 2023/24, said Hammond. \u201cWe are within touching distance,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it will be a policy decision at successive fiscal events how to balance whatever available fiscal headroom there is between reducing the deficit, reducing taxes, increasing spending on current public service consumption and investing in capital infrastructure for the future.\u201d Hammond said he and prime minister Theresa May had made clear that ending austerity did not simply mean loosening the purse-strings in the public sector. \u201cFrom our point of view, austerity is not only a measure of public sector spending, it also refers to broader issues,\u201d he said. \u201cAs austerity comes to an end, I would want to see our public services being financed more generously than they were over the period of fiscal consolidation. \u201cAnd I would want to see real wages growing sustainably so that households could expect incomes and living standards to be rising year on year. And as part of that, I would want to see them being able to anticipate keeping a larger proportion of the income they earned in their own pockets. \u201cAll of this implies sustained economic growth over a period of time.\u201d Charlie Elphicke, the Tory currently sitting as an independent, goes next. Hammond says, in a no deal Brexit where the UK did not have action to EU markets on a low-friction basis, there would be considerable disruption in the short term. In the long term, the economy would reconfigure. Some activities might stop. But other activities would start up, for example to fill the gaps created by friction in the EU supply chain. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative committee chair, goes next. Q: Will the government match current levels of spending for farming? And what about European Investment Bank funding? Hammond says the agricultural sector has had \u201cgenerous guarantees\u201d lasting until the end of this parliament. He says most EIB funding goes to big players. It will not be difficult for them to find alternative methods of funding. Q: This time last year, when you were asked if you thought any of the benefits of future trade deals would outweigh the losses of leaving, you could not say. Can you say today? Hammond says the preliminary Whitehall analysis, leaked and subsequently published, did contain figures for both those factors - benefits from trade deals, and losses from leaving the EU. Q: And under all Brexit scenarios the economy takes a hit. Hammond says this is based on an economic model looking at the longterm impact. None of the outcomes was the government\u2019s preferred model. But each of those models showed the economy doing worse than under the status quo. Hammond says, if the deal allows existing supply chains to continue, that will give a boost to business confidence. He says he is also holding \u201csignificant fiscal buffers\u201d (the ability to borrow more than he actually is borrowing now). If there is a good deal, he will not need those powers. Q: It is not really a dividend is it? It is headroom that is available to use it? Q: But it is not really a dividend, is it? Most people would see it as such, he says. He says he would have a choice. Q: The PM said the extra money for the NHS would come from a Brexit dividend. Have you calculated the Brexit dividend? Hammond says there is forecast for spending on public services after Brexit. He says the PM was making a narrower point; if the government is not giving \u00a39bn or \u00a310bn to Brussels, it can spend that money on other things. Q: But what about the additional costs to the Treasury as a result of Brexit? Hammond says the cross-Whitehall financial analysis will look at this. Labour\u2019s Catherine McKinnell goes next. Q: The OBR says it is not clear what the Brexit deal will say. So why are you predicted a deal dividend? Hammond says they are saying the same thing. The OBR feels it cannot be confident of factoring in changes until they occur. But Hammond says he is confident that, if there is a deal, that will be good for business. The SNP\u2019s Stewart Hosie goes next. Q: In your Tory conference speech you said, when it comes to taxing tech giants internationally, the time for stalling has to stop. Who is doing the stalling? Hammond says it would be diplomatic not to say. But he says US tax changes mean some of these firms\u2019 profits will be posted in the US for tax purposes. That may have an impact on US motives, he says. This story, by HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh, explains the point Wes Streeting was making when he accused Philip Hammond of not allowing MPs to make amendments to the budget. (See 5.25pm.) Q: You have cut taxes, and those cuts will mostly benefit the wealthy. As an MP, I cannot persuade you to allocate money from one area to another. You have framed the finance bill in a way that makes this hard. Is that because there are so many Tory MPs who don\u2019t agree with your priorities. Shouldn\u2019t parliament have the right to amend this budget, so that money gets spend elsewhere? Hammond says Streeting is entitled to his opinion. He says parliament has never had control through the budget process of how money is allocated between departments. That is a matter for the estimates process, he says. He says the budget process in the UK is different from in other countries. That\u2019s true, says Streeting, but he says the government has made it even more limited. Hammond says it is not the tradition in the UK to allow line-by-line changes to the budget. Q: Do you understand why people were so angry about your comment about schools getting money for \u201clittle extras\u201d? Hammond says you cannot use an in-year underspend to fund recurring costs. He says he was \u201cquite surprised\u201d by the negative reaction to his remark. And he was disappointed too, he says. Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting goes next. Q: When will the next spending review be? In 2019, Hammond says. Q: When in 2019? Hammond says his intention is to report the outcome in the budget in the autumn of 2019. But he cannot say when it will start. Q: Why did you spend more on pot holes than schools? Hammond says this was not a spending review. The spending review will look at school budgets. He says a reduction in borrowing in 2018/19 meant he could spend more this year. But he says it is harder than it sounds to spend money. He could not spend the money on things with recurring costs, like salaries. But spending money on pot holes does not have a recurring costs. Councils are well able to spend this money. And schools will get a one-off check. They will be able to spend it on things worth having. If they don\u2019t think these things are worth having, someone else will spend it for them. Q: You said, if there is a successful Brexit deal, you would release some of your fiscal headroom. Won\u2019t you have to release it anyway? Hammond says, if there is a successful deal, confidence will return to the economy quickly. He says he will be able to release that headroom (ie, spend money effectively held in reserve) quickly. Borrowing could rise a bit, he says. He says, if there is no deal, there will be an impact on the economy. But he would have to wait and see how the economy responded. Then, working with the Bank of England, he would have to consider the appropriate spending response (ie, how much extra the government would have to spend). Q: How much more slowly will debt fall because of your spending plans? Hammond says debt will fall more slowly, but he cannot give a figure quantifying the slowdown. Stephen Hammond, a Conservative, goes next. Q: Is it sensible to plan so much spending on the basis of a forecast increased in tax receipts? Hammond says the OBR thinks these higher revenues will be sustained. The increase is largely driven by employment, he says. He says the OBR is very careful. It thinks hard before it changes its forecasting, he says. He says he would not expect the OBR to be changing its forecasts for fiscal receipts any time soon. He also says, before he even delivered his budget, the govenment had already committed to extra spending worth \u00a384bn (the extra NHS spending). Q: In May this year the government suggested that the new fixed odds betting terminal rules would come into effect in April, not October? Hammond says the new rules will take effect 12 months after the budget. He says he has no love for these machines. \u201cI think they are terrible things.\u201d But the reduction in the maximum stake, from \u00a3100 to \u00a32, must be introduced in an orderly way. The industry thinks 15,000 to 20,000 jobs could be lost. There has to be a balancing of the different interests involved, he says. He says having October 2019 as the implementation date was a sensible compromise between the competing interests. Q: Tracey Crouch said last week when she resigned over this that two people die every week as a consequence of gambling addiction. The government implies this would come in the spring of 2019. You could bring forward the tax increase for the gaming industry that will compensate for the lost income. Why have you ignored the suicide concerns. Hammond says the industry has been clear that, with stakes of just \u00a32, the FOBT will go. Getting stakes down to this level will effectively eliminate these machines. He says that is a tribute to Crouch\u2019s tenacity campaigning on this. She has won the argument. But government has to implement these measures \u201cin a way that is balanced and fair and allows for an orderly transition.\u201d Hammond says fixed odds betting terminals will disappear after maximum stake gets reduced to \u00a32. Q: That does not help the 300 people a day who will be harmed by gambling? Hammond says there are many social problems that drive mental health problems and, sadly, suicides. Q: You said austerity is coming to an end. What does that mean? Hammond says that is a good question. He says austerity does not just refer to spending. He would like to see real wages growing, and people being able to keep a larger proportion of their income. That requires sustained growth. Q: Have you abandoned plans to run a surplus? No, says Hammond. He says he has always called for a balanced approach. Q: After the Brexit deal, how long will it be before the Treasury completes its impact analysis? Hammond says it is not a Treasury analysis. It is a cross-government analysis. DExEU is in the lead, he says. But the Treasury has a big input. He says some preliminary work is underway now. But until details of the deal are known, they cannot do the full analysis. Q: How much time will parliament get to consider this analysis? \u201cAdequate time\u201d, says Hammond. He says the details of the time set aside for consideration of this, and for the debate on the deal, are matters for the business managers. Hammond says MPs will get \u201cadequate time\u201d to consider the Brexit deal. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee now about the budget. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative chair of the committee, starts by asking about the complaint from the Office for Budget Responsibility that it only had limited time to consider the budget plans. Hammond says the budget timetable was compressed. That was to ensure the budget debate could finish before this week\u2019s mini recess, to allow time for Brexit-related parliamentary business later, he says. And he says the scale of the OBC\u2019s forecast revisions also created problems. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, has just announced significant changes to the way universal credit operates in a Commons statement, the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom reports. The Cabinet Office and Downing Street have been flying flags at half mast today in honour of Jeremy Heywood, the former cabinet secretary whose death was announced yesterday. Earlier I mentioned today\u2019s Electoral Commission report saying that the Ian Paisley recall petition was well organised. (See 10.48am.) It said that even though only three venues were made available where people could sign the petition, even though up to 10 would have been permissible, this did not affect result (which saw the bid to hold a byelection fall short by fewer than 500 signatures). Sinn Fein says this conclusion \u201cdefies all logic\u201d. In a statement the Sinn Fein MLA (member of the legislative assembly) Philip McGuigan said: The Electoral Office had the option of opening up to ten locations where people could sign the petition, yet they opted to go for just three and now the Electoral Commission has concluded that this did not affect the outcome of the petition. That conclusion defies all logic and ignores the evidence on the ground where people were clearly stating that accessibility was a huge factor. The lack of an effective public awareness campaign and worker-friendly opening hours were also major concerns that the Electoral Commission have not satisfactorily addressed. The Electoral Office failed in its responsibilities to the people of North Antrim in the way it handled this petition and the commission should be holding them to account for those failures. According to UTV\u2019s Ken Reid, Paisley will be back in the Commons before the end of this month. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, has written an open letter to Jeremy Corbyn urging Labour to join the SNP in backing a Brexit that involves the UK staying in the single market and the customs union. He says: Last week, I led a delegation with their party leaders to Brussels to meet Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. Our cross party delegation united in common cause to ensure that Europe understood that staying in the single market and the customs union had support right across the UK despite the utterances from the extreme Brexiteers and the prime minister. I was delighted to learn that Mr Barnier is also open to that option and so there is still time to secure our economic future before exit day. Despite our political differences, I am confident there is consensus in Labour\u2019s benches to back our plans and I remain convinced that there is a majority in parliament for this outcome. Single market and customs union membership is the best way to protect Scotland and the UK from the worst of the Brexit economic shock. This does not seem to be a letter written in the expectation that it will receive a positive reply. Labour is committed to staying in a customs union with the EU, but Corbyn has ruled out staying in the single market, mostly because that would involve accepting freedom of movement, but also partly because of concerns about how EU state aid rules (which come with single market membership) could constrain the activities of a Labour government. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, asks her urgent question about EU nationals and a no deal Brexit. Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, is replying. She says, in the event of a no deal Brexit, all EU citizens will be welcome to stay. Last week Theresa May extended that commitment to citizens of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and shortly a deal will cover Swiss citizens too. Cooper says she is none the wiser about what checks might apply to EU nationals in the event of there being no deal. Last week Nokes said there would be additional checks. But Sajid Javid, the home secretary, then told the media that would not be the case, she says. If no checks are imposed, will that apply until the settlement scheme takes effect? She says the Home Office has been unable to answer basic questions on this. Nokes thanks Cooper for giving her the chance to clarify this point. Employers already need to inspect documents for EU nationals. But the government will not be asking them to differentiate between new EU arrivals and EU nationals already resident here. In due course further details will be announced, she says. The government is to ask competition authorities to investigate the practice of selling new houses on a leasehold basis, with a ground rent that increases over time, the latest official move to crack down on the practice. Builders will already be banned from selling new houses on a leasehold basis, but now the communities secretary, James Brokenshire, has called for the Competition and Markets Authority to act immediately to help those already stuck in exploitative leasehold clauses, which his department estimates to be 100,000 householders. While houses traditionally were sold on a freehold basis, a recent practice has been to have a leasehold sale, with the owners obliged to pay a ground rent each year. These can rise, and in some cases have a clause in the lease where the amount doubles every ten years, eventually reaching thousands of pounds annually, trapping people in unsaleable homes. Brokenshire has also written to the Solicitors Regulation Authority to seek an investigation into conveyancing solicitors who may have mis-sold properties with such clauses in place. The Law Commission was asked last year by Brokenshire\u2019s predecessor, Sajid Javid, to look into ways owners could be allowed to buy freeholds easily and cheaply. Brokenshire told MPs this afternoon: Unfair leasehold practices have no place in a modern housing market, neither do excessive ground rents which exploit consumers. I am very conscious of some of the bad practices that we have seen in the leasehold market which is why I will be meeting with the industry later this week to underline the need for redress, and for solutions to be offered to people who frankly have been mis-sold in a number of cases. Speaking to reporters this morning Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said that a backstop with a three-month time limit would not be worth the paper it was written on. He also implied that the UK as trying to wriggle out of the commitments it made in December last year, when it agreed to an Irish backstop (without time limit) in the joint report (pdf). Referring to the idea reportedly floated by Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary (see 9.22am and 12.44am), Varadkar said: A backstop with a three-month limit on it or expiry date of that nature isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s written on and what the backstop the UK government has signed up to is a legally operative backstop that will apply unless, and until, we have any agreement to supersede it. I think it\u2019s reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK government to stand by its commitments. He also said that the UK was a \u201cdivided kingdom\u201d, which was making the Brexit negotiation more difficult. He explained: The UK in many ways is a divided kingdom, the people are split 50/50 over whether they want to leave the European Union or not. The cabinet seems divided, the government seems divided, parliament is divided, and that has made it very difficult to come to an agreement. I\u2019d much prefer to have a united kingdom, a united country, to be our partner in these negotiations, but we don\u2019t, so we have to work through. Thankfully in Ireland we have a government that is united, and we have in parliament as well, that\u2019s largely united behind the government on this issue. In other words, Varadkar seemed to be saying that the Republic, not the UK, is the real united kingdom. Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, has posted a Twitter thread that explains the backstop conundrum particularly clearly. It starts here. The Department for Transport has issued a paper today (pdf) about how permits could be issued to hauliers to allow them to operate on the continent after Brexit. It says it hopes that there will be a deal and that permits will not be necessary. But in the event of there being no Brexit deal, hauliers will need permits - and the number of ECMT [European Conference of Ministers of Transport] permits available is much, much smaller than the number of hauliers who might want one (only 5% of the total, according to one estimate). The paper explains how ECMT permits would be allocated. Various criteria will be used. But there will also be a random element, the paper says, to increase the number of haulage companies that benefit. It says: We believe it is important that a large number of UK hauliers can continue to haul goods internationally. Including a weighted random element to the scoring of applications will give the highest scoring operators many, but not all, of the permits they applied for. Instead, those permits are allocated to a larger number of operators who have also scored highly on the other criteria. It also gives a fair and equitable chance for small and medium sized operators to receive permits. We estimate that around four times as many operators will receive permits if an element of weighted random selection is included in the allocation process. UPDATE: In the comments heemstra points out, rightly, that this is a problem not just for hauliers, but for industry generally. Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, has told Theresa May in a phone call that he would oppose any plan for the Irish backstop that would allow the UK to opt out unilaterally. (See 1.19pm.) The backstop is the key issue preventing the UK and the EU reaching an agreement for the UK\u2019s withdrawal. Both sides accept that there must be a mechanism (the backstop) to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit if other provisions supposed to ensure this (a future trade deal involving frictionless borders) don\u2019t materialise. But London and Brussels cannot agree on the details. The environment department has been accused of \u201cpanic\u201d over Brexit after a leaked document revealed the emergency redeployment of staff to prepare for a no-deal scenario. A \u201cno-deal safety net unit\u201d is being rushed through by Scotland Yard at a cost of more than \u00a32.4m after police chiefs warned the home secretary that losing EU tools would make it harder to track sex offenders and terrorist suspects, according to internal police documents. More than a thousand Irish academics, film-makers, lawyers, writers, athletes, business owners and others have signed an open letter to the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, asking him to protect the rights of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, who is responsible for overseeing the British media industry, has told an audience of newspaper editors that he doesn\u2019t subscribe to any British newspapers or magazines. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said in a speech that the NHS will not be sustainable without a \u201cradical shift\u201d towards preventing disease and illness. The Ministry of Defence must find \u201cimmediate\u201d savings to address a \u00a37bn black hole in the armed forces equipment budget, the National Audit Office has said. There will be an urgent question in the Commons at 3.30pm on what will happen to EU nationals in the event of there being a no-deal Brexit, prompted by Caroline Nokes\u2019 much-criticised evidence to the home affairs committee on this subject last week. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has already had to correct his junior minister and declared that employers hiring EU nationals won\u2019t be expected to check when they entered the country from April next year if there\u2019s a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street has now released its own read-out of the May/Varadkar conversation. Unlike the department of the taoiseach, which does not use an equivalent adjective to describe the nature of the conversation, Downing Street says the call was \u201cconstructive\u201d. It also stresses May\u2019s desire for the backstop to be temporary. Here is the read-out in full. The prime minister spoke to the taoiseach this morning to take stock of the progress being made in the negotiations, including on the Northern Ireland backstop. In a constructive conversation, the prime minister and the taoiseach discussed the remaining issues. They agreed that the intention was that the backstop should only be a temporary arrangement and that the best solution to the Northern Ireland border would be found by agreeing a future relationship between the UK and the EU. In order to ensure that the backstop, if ever needed, would be temporary, the prime minister said that there would need to be a mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end. She affirmed the UK\u2019s commitment to the Belfast Good Friday agreement and to avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The prime minister and the taoiseach agreed that discussions should continue. Here is the full text of the read-out from Leo Varadkar\u2019s office of the content of his call with Theresa May this morning. (See 1.09pm.) An taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke to the British prime minister, Theresa May, this morning by phone. She sought the call in order to update the taoiseach on the current state of the Brexit negotiations. Both leaders emphasised their commitment to avoiding a hard border and the need for a legally operable backstop. The prime minister raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop. The taoiseach indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop. He recalled the prior commitments made that the backstop must apply \u2018unless and until\u2019 alternative arrangements are agreed. They both expressed the hope that the negotiations could conclude in a satisfactory manner as soon as possible. Theresa May spoke to Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, this morning. The Irish have released their read-out, and it shows that Varadkar reiterated Dublin\u2019s opposition to any backstop plan that would allow the UK unilaterally to withdraw from it. That\u2019s the point Simon Coveney, Varadkar\u2019s deputy, made this morning. (See 9.22am.) This is from Sky\u2019s David Blevins. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. On Brexit Downing Street played down suggestions that a Brexit breakthrough is imminent. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists: We continue to make good progress in the negotiations but there is work still to do. Yesterday the Sunday Times splashed on a report purporting to give details of Theresa May\u2019s \u201csecret plan to secure a Brexit deal\u201d. The spokesman was dismissive. I have read in the past 24 hours that we have done a deal, that it was 50/50, that a deal was hanging by a thread and - my favourite - that we are in a \u2018doom loop\u2019. As my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports, if there is going to be an emergency EU Brexit summit this week, it is now not expected until the last week of November. The spokesman confirmed that Brexit will be discussed at tomorrow\u2019s cabinet, but played down suggestions that this would be the moment when Theresa May would present her colleagues with a final deal that they would have to accept or reject. Ministers would be discussing deal and no deal scenarios, he said. The spokesman did not deny the Telegraph story saying Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, privately told the Irish foreign minister that he wanted the UK to be able to leave the backstop after three or six months. (See 9.22am.) The spokesman said he did not comment on \u201cprivate conversations\u201d. But he did confirm that the government wants to ensure that the backstop is not in place indefinitely and that the deal includes a mechanism to achieve that. The position that we have set out is we don\u2019t want the backstop to be in place indefinitely and we will be looking to a mechanism to achieve that. The spokesman would not say whether Raab would be travelling to Brussels this week for talks with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. (If he does go, that suggests there\u2019s been a breakthrough; if not, ongoing stalemate.) The spokesman refused to respond to Boris Johnson\u2019s latest newspaper attack on the PM\u2019s Brexit strategy. (See 9.22am.) \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything new in that article for me to respond to,\u201d the spokesman said. On other matters Downing Street criticised Washington\u2019s decision to reimpose sanction against Iran. Asked about the move, which follows President Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, the spokesman said: We regret the reimposition of sanctions by the US. We continue to believe that the Iran nuclear deal makes the world a safer place and our position remains that as long as Iran continues to meet its obligations under the deal, by respecting strict limits on its nuclear activity, we will be committed to it too. As such, we continue to fully support expanding our trade relationship with Iran and encourage UK businesses to take advantage of the commercial opportunities that arise. The spokesman accepted that there was \u201cmore to do\u201d in tackling knife crime. But, when the subject was raised in the light of the three fatal stabbings in London in recent days, the spokesman also highlighted measures already taken by the government, including more support for those at risk of knife crime, \u00a322m for an early intervention youth fund, \u00a31.5m for anti-knife crime projects, and the publication of a serious violence strategy. The spokesman said a new sports minister, to replace Tracey Crouch, will be appointed today. The spokesman refused to comment on the revelation that Jeremy Wright, who as culture secretary oversees media policy for the government, does not subscribe to any newspapers. He said he had no seen Wright\u2019s comment. But he assured journalists that May \u201cdoes read newspapers\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s a healthy supply of newspapers to the PM\u2019s private office\u201d. Wright made his comments at the Society of Editors conference, my colleague Jim Waterson reports. Wright also struggled to name a female columnist he admires. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has written an interesting post on his Facebook page about the Brexit talks. Here\u2019s an extract. Because the British government \u2013 not Brussels, not the EU 27 leaders \u2013 has decided that unless there is a deal this month, the default option of a no-deal Brexit becomes the probable outcome. \u201cWe don\u2019t want no-deal. But because of the parliamentary timetable it becomes very hard to avoid if talks continue past this month,\u201d said a senior member of the government. \u201cAnd that is why negotiation have massively shifted up a gear, with officials working through the night.\u201d The important dates are tomorrow, when the prime minister briefs her cabinet on the likely shape of a deal, and (probably) next Monday \u2013 which is the probable cut-off day for organising an emergency Brexit council of EU leaders. And RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly has written a useful Twitter thread on the process. It starts here. There are two statements in the Commons today. The Brexit talks have entered a stage being described by insiders as \u201cthe tunnel\u201d. Proverbially there may be light at the end of the tunnel. But, on the basis of what we were told at the Downing Street lobby briefing, there is certainly no light coming out of it at the moment. We learnt nothing of substance about the negotiations. Still, in the interests of thoroughness, I will post a summary, squeezing the flannel for every last drop of Brexit intel, with all the non-Brexit lines that emerged too. Channel 4 News has released some new polling showing support for a second referendum on Brexit. Here are the figures. More results from the poll will be released tonight. I\u2019m off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. In September the DUP MP Ian Paisley narrowly survived an attempt to force him to defend his seat in a byelection. After he was suspended from the Commons for becoming a \u201cpaid advocate\u201d for the Sri Lankan government and failing to declare family holidays worth at least \u00a350,000, opponents used the recall procedure introduced by the coalition government to try to trigger a recall byelection. But they needed 10% of the electorate in North Antrim to sign the recall petition, and in the event they collected signatures from just 9.4% in the time allowed (7,099 people, not the 7,543 required). There were complaints at the time that only three venues were opened where people could sign the petition. Up to 10 were allowed under the legislation. But, in a report today, the Electoral Commission concludes that the petition was well-run and that having more signing places would not have affected the outcome. It says: We recognise that the decision to use only three signing places was the subject of much debate and criticism. However, we have found no evidence that an increased number of signing places would have contributed to a different result at the end of the recall petition. This was the first time a recall petition had been organised under the Recall of MPs Act. The petition was open for six weeks, but the commission says in its report that this was too long and that the government should consider shortening the signing period for future petitions. The Downing Street Brexit strategy seems to be relying heavily on the assumption that, even if Tory MPs strongly dislike some aspects of her deal, when faced with the choice between that and a no vote that would trigger a crisis, and possibly a no-deal Brexit, they would reluctantly vote for the compromise. But on the Today programme this morning Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general who led the Commons revolt on the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d last year, said he did not accept that logic. He told the programme: I don\u2019t accept that rejecting the deal would necessarily mean it is no deal at all. Of course it would provoke a political crisis ... but there comes a point where you have to look to the long-term. If the long-term is that we are simply going to be continuing this argument long after we\u2019ve left the EU on 29 March next year as to what our future relationship with it is going to be, then, quite frankly, it would be better to have that argument now and let the public decide what they want and if they are content with the arrangements the government has come up with. Grieve also used the interview to express reservations about the idea of the UK remaining in the EU customs union for good (which is what many suspect would be the eventual outcome if Theresa May were to agree to the UK as a whole staying in the customs union as her version of the Irish backstop, without the UK having an opt-out clause). Grieve said: At the end of the day [the prospect of the UK staying in the customs union for good] highlights why the entire enterprise is questionable, because in fact what we are likely to end up with is leaving the EU but staying in a relationship of sufficient dependency on it without influence as to call into question the whole project. Ironically, this argument is very similar to the one that Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, is making in his Sun column \u2013 from the opposite end of the Brexit spectrum. Johnson said: We will be told that we have protected \u2018our precious union\u2019. But we have done that by agreeing that the whole of the UK will remain in the EU\u2019s customs union, and in alignment with the EU\u2019s rulebook on goods and agriculture and much else besides. We have agreed to remain in vassalage forever. We have gone along with the claptrap that this is essential \u2013 as the only way to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Sabine Weyand, who is deputy to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has given Simon Coveney\u2019s Irish backstop tweet (see 9.22am) the Brussels stamp of approval. Not for the first time, we are entering what seems to be a crucial week for Brexit. As the Guardian reports, by Friday the EU will have to decide whether there has been enough progress towards a deal to justify scheduling an emergency summit later this month to finalise it. (The talks could extend into December, but Theresa May would rather avoid that because then there would be no chance of getting the parliamentary vote over before Christmas, the whole deal could unwind over the holidays, and even if it didn\u2019t, it would start getting very hard getting all the required legislation through parliament before the end of March.) But the UK and the EU remain at odds over the Irish backstop. The Daily Telegraph (paywall) today claims that Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, last week told the Irish government that he wanted the UK to be able to leave the backstop within three or six months. The paper reports: Mr Raab\u2019s proposal to [Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister] was that within three months of the backstop coming into force \u2013 or six months at the very most \u2013 the UK would have the unilateral right to trigger a \u201creview mechanism\u201d in which the backstop would only persist by \u201cmutual consent\u201d. \u201cThe idea that an alternative arrangement that delivers no hard border in Ireland would be ready in three months is totally unrealistic,\u201d said a senior EU source, adding that it was \u201chard to believe\u201d that Mr Raab was not aware of that. Mr Raab\u2019s position was apparently contradicted by Mr Lidington on a visit to Dublin last Friday for a British-Irish intergovernmental conference at which the two leaders said they were \u201cvery close\u201d to a deal. In an article in the Sun today Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, said that without the ability to terminate the backstop, the UK will \u201cremain in vassalage forever\u201d. But this morning Simon Coveney has insisted that the EU will never agree to a \u201ctime-limited backstop\u201d. He posted this on Twitter. More on this all day, of course \u2013 and all week, and no doubt ad infinitum. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, speaks at the International Association of National Public Health Institutes annual meeting. As Denis Campbell reports, Hancock will call for a big increase in people making healthier lifestyle choices, such as reducing the amount of alcohol and junk food they consume. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 3.30pm: MPs debate the Laura Cox report into the bullying and harassment of Commons staff. 4pm: Jon Thompson, permanent secretary at HM Revenue and Customs, and Paul Lincoln, director general of the Border Force, give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about Brexit planning. 4.30pm: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the budget. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up, after the Hammond hearing is over. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.", "14||Heathrow's arrogant response to its regulator will not flyHeathrow\u2019s third runway must be \u201ccost-efficient and sustainable\u201d and \u201cminimise costs to airlines, passengers and freight owners\u201d, according to the government\u2019s policy statement that gave the go-ahead for expansion in June. What does that mean in hard numbers? And who is on the hook if the cost of the project explodes beyond \u00a314bn? Heathrow\u2019s private-sector owners or paying passengers? The questions were left unanswered in the summer. Transport secretary Chris Grayling muttered ineffectually about the need for \u201caffordable\u201d numbers and details were left to the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to work out. After many months of pushing Heathrow for information, CAA chief executive Richard Moriarty sounds exasperated. His \u201cinterim update\u201d to the Department for Transport was a long complaint about \u201cthe lack of high quality and comprehensive information\u201d from Heathrow on costs and efficiency. Concerns \u201chave not yet been adequately addressed\u201d. The company must \u201curgently and demonstrably\u201d rise to the challenge. Unless there is \u201ca significant improvement\u201d, the regulator may use its formal powers to intervene. In most industries, a rebuke in that style would be met with an immediate promise to do better. Heathrow\u2019s response, however, amounted to a shrug of the shoulders. The airport said it will present its planning masterplan next year and didn\u2019t even attempt to explain why it has not satisfied the CAA\u2019s long-standing and reasonable requests. Heathrow\u2019s owners, one suspects, take the view that the regulator is a minor distraction and that the real battle was won with the parliamentary vote. It may be right, but it is an arrogant way to behave. The high-handed response will also deepen fears that a splendidly protected company is preparing a proposal in which other people are expected to underwrite the construction risks. Not good enough. Bets off on Brexit certainty On 9 November, if the nation\u2019s economists are correct, the UK will report third-quarter growth in GDP of 0.6%, a relative triumph when you look across the channel at the 0.2% recorded last week by the eurozone for the July-September period. Enjoy the moment while you can. The latest data suggests Brexit-induced worries are now biting. The dominant services sector grew at its slowest pace for seven months in October, according to the monthly survey of executives by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. Brexit was perhaps not the only explanation since Chris Williamson, IHS Markit\u2019s chief business economist, had other factors on his list, including a global slowdown, trade wars and geopolitics. But, as he says, the detail of the report offers \u201cmounting evidence that Brexit worries are taking an increasing toll on the economy.\u201d On this evidence, overall growth in the fourth quarter could be a sluggish eurozone-style 0.2%. If you are optimist, the drag will disappear when, or if, Theresa May secures a negotiated deal. According to this line of thinking, pent-up investment will be released and the chancellor\u2019s expansionary budget will become the story. Well, maybe. It seems equally likely that any withdrawal agreement with Brussels will be so fudged that it raises as many questions as it answers about the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU. If business is waiting for certainty, it may be disappointed. The lure of the limelight You understand why Chris Kennedy, finance director of Micro Focus, might prefer to count numbers for a different employer. He joined the FTSE 100 software outfit only in January this year, which allowed just enough time to prepare the details on a huge profit warning in March that almost halved the share price. Micro Focus was instantly reclassified as a problem stock, as opposed to the go-go business that had shelled out \u00a36.6bn for a large chunk of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise\u2019s operations in 2017. Now Kennedy is off to ITV. Television probably offers more excitement than software ever will, and he will be reunited with Dame Carolyn McCall, his old boss from easyJet days. All the same, quitting after 10 months \u2013 or 12 by the time he\u2019s totted up the full-year numbers \u2013 is a bit quick, isn\u2019t it? Micro Focus would be entitled to be annoyed.", "0||Malta's Pilatus Bank has European licence withdrawnA Maltese bank at the heart of a money-laundering investigation has had its licence withdrawn by the European Central Bank. Pilatus Bank, which opened four years ago, was officially closed down several months after its Iranian chairman and owner, Ali Sadr Hasheminejad, was charged in the US in connection with money-laundering and fraud. The bank had also been accused of processing corrupt payments to Maltese officials by the investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed last year by a car bomb. The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), which regulates the country\u2019s banking industry and granted Pilatus a licence in 2014, said the ECB had acted on its request to close the bank. In a statement on Monday the MFSA said: \u201cFurther to the authority\u2019s proposal to the ECB to withdraw the authorisation of Pilatus Bank as a credit institution, the ECB\u2019s governing council has decided to withdraw the authorisation of Pilatus Bank with effect from today.\u201d The EU began an investigation into Malta\u2019s regulation of the bank last year, following Caruana Galizia\u2019s death, with the European Banking Authority (EBA) undertaking the inquiries. Then in March, Sadr was arrested in the US on charges that he had violated the country\u2019s sanctions and anti-money-laundering rules. According to the indictment, filed in New York, Sadr participated in a scheme to illegally funnel $115m (\u00a388m) in payments for a Venezuelan construction project to Iranian individuals and companies. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Straight after his arrest the MFSA took control of Pilatus, freezing all transactions for customers, and banning executives and shareholders from withdrawing any funds from the bank. In June, it filed a recommendation with the ECB for the withdrawal of Pilatus\u2019s licence, on the grounds of Ali Sadr\u2019s arrest and concerns that it had persistently breached liquidity rules since he was charged. Reuters has reported that the European commission was considering actions against Maltese authorities over their handling of the case. At the time of her death Caruana Galizia was being sued in a US court by Pilatus and Sadr in a lawsuit that accused her of malice, defamation and causing damage to the bank\u2019s \u201creputation and actual and prospective economic relationships\u201d. She had reported on the Panama Papers, which alleged links between the prime minister of Malta\u2019s wife and shell companies that held accounts with Pilatus. Pilatus had been set to open an office in London\u2019s Mayfair in April 2017. The Maltese regulator had granted it a passport to operate in in the UK but it was never given permission to offer accounts to UK residents. The bank, which reported \u20ac308m (\u00a3270m) of assets in 2016, was known to have held accounts for a senior official in the government of the Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and members of Azerbaijan\u2019s ruling family. The ECB did not comment on the decision to withdraw its licence.", "8||The Guardian view on life expectancy stalling: a political choiceIn 2010 a government-commissioned review looking at the relationship between health and wealth \u2013 only the third officially sanctioned attempt to do so in 30 years \u2013 came to the conclusion that life expectancy is linked to social standing and so is the time spent in good health. Lower life expectancies in the UK were not those associated with destitution but rather despair and expectation. Poorer people suffer diseases because of bad diets, a lack of exercise, smoking, poor pay and job insecurity. Its message was twofold. First, government intervention was necessary to ensure that people\u2019s freedoms were not bad for their health. Second, the state had a responsibility to assure people\u2019s material security. Tory health secretaries did no more than pay lip service to such ideas. The result has been rising death rates. The 2010 report, authored by the epidemiologist Sir Michael Marmot, called for national targets on life expectancy, suggesting that policies were put in place to increase the lifetime of a poor person by three years by 2020. That target is not going to be reached. Last month it was confirmed that UK life expectancy has stopped improving for the first time in more than 35 years. In terms of length of life, the UK lags behind other developed nations. Young people are now less likely to live longer than their parents. Ministers initially blamed the figures on flu deaths. A more plausible explanation is the politics of austerity, which had an excessive impact on the poor, the disabled and the elderly. Local councils cannot pay for home visits, cuts have led to rising levels of homelessness, fuel poverty and food bank visits. It is shocking that 18-year-olds with learning disabilities may well not live long enough to draw their pension. As lives are at stake, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has managed to be absurdly unoriginal in approaching this. His policy rests substantially on old, failed ideas that personal responsibility and technology can solve the problem. Eating more fruit and salads is a great idea. But has Mr Hancock wondered what to tell those in the bottom income decile who, if they followed Public Health England\u2019s healthy eating guidelines, would discover that about 70% of their household income had been spent on food? How can they afford to take responsible options \u2013 and pay their rent and keep warm? Why fixate on genomics as a preventive measure? A person may be genetically predisposed to a disease. It does not mean they will contract it. Environment swamps such risks. The NHS will get extra money. But last month\u2019s budget saw further cuts of \u00a3200m to public health services, which have already seen reductions of \u00a3500m since 2014-15. Mr Hancock\u2019s defence is that Britain has high levels of employment. True, but at what cost to society, when employment cannot support a stable life? Jobs where hours and income fluctuate can wreak havoc with benefits and childcare. They wear workers out mentally. Recent research found that some jobs might be even worse than unemployment for one\u2019s health: people moving into poor-quality work were found to have the highest levels of chronic stress, higher than that recorded by jobless workers. At the heart of this debate is the government\u2019s refusal to engage with inequality. This is an error borne out of ideology. We know that children from poorer backgrounds are more affected by the rise in childhood obesity. So why allow the number of children living in poverty to breach 5 million by 2022, up from around 4 million at present? It is because a key belief in free-market societies is that they reward the industrious and punish the idle. In this system, individuals must have the freedom to choose \u2013 and with that freedom would come responsibility. The market, in this system, would not only improve British society; it would remoralise it. To have faith in such an unfettered model of capitalism is a political choice. When applied to public health, the appalling price appears to be to stall progress in life expectancy.", "8||Let me eat cake: the health secretary\u2019s prevention talk is meaninglessAlcohol, sugar, salt and fat. These are a few of my favourite things. But because I want to live into spritely old age I must apparently use my enormous willpower to banish these evils from my life. Why? Because yet another puffed up young man, this one called Matt Hancock, tells me to. Who is he? A doctor? I ask not because dementia has taken hold after I once ate some bacon, but because, really, who is he to tell me how to live? He is the health secretary \u2013 ie a souped-up accountant. Prevention is better than cure, he says. Doh! These messages are pumped out so routinely as to be meaningless. I may as well relocate to Grimsby, which, we were recently informed, had the unhealthiest high street in the land, full of tanning shops, fast-food outlets and betting shops. I am sure Hancock\u2019s nugget of information made the people there much better equipped to make \u201chealthy choices\u201d. As you may have realised, I am, by now, absolutely sick of this relentless language of choice. Here is what a healthy choice actually is: being well off enough to live in Taunton or some other centre of fake nutritional excellence, to have enough time and energy and money to exercise properly, to live in a place with little air pollution, to bore on about \u201cwellness\u201d with like-minded people. If anything is going to shorten my life span, it is people who think you are interested in conversations about \u201cbloating\u201d. But it\u2019s a choice! Everyone knows about the links between obesity and deprivation, and those links are now being made between all manner of ill health and air pollution, so another lecture about individual choice is actually a shirking of accountability. Of course, individuals can make choices and even reverse chronic illness. Who hasn\u2019t cheered on MP Tom Watson, who lost seven stone and reversed his diabetes? Many people learn to manage their pain better through diets. They need all the support they can get. But most people live in a permanent state of confusion, excluding and then bingeing on a food group. Fat was bad and now it\u2019s good. Sugar is the enemy. Really, you are not what you eat unless of course you are Jordan Peterson on his all-beef diet and come to resemble an angry Peperami. Eat less, move more: this basic advice is not new, but in the land of food banks, rough sleeping and an under-resourced NHS, it is increasingly solipsistic. The current discourse around causes of cancer, something half of us will get, is not always helpful. There are no deserving and undeserving cases. If one has a genetic predisposition to certain diseases, clacking on about chia seeds is profoundly useless. The serious issue here is about how many years of our lives are going to be spent in pain. Old age ain\u2019t for sissies and people are now living for 20 years with multiple illnesses before they die. So we return to prevention. If you can control your impulses now, then in 50 years you may still be able to get up the stairs. This could work for some, but not me. I thought we were meant to find joy in the moment, and that certainly never involves tofu. The job of policymakers is to improve public health by tackling the polluters and the food industry. Things can change: look at smoking. If you let the free market run riot you end up with dire inequality and ill health, failing care for the elderly and a struggling NHS. The free market does not care about your Fitbit except to sell it to you. When the health secretary wants to talk about this dereliction of political responsibility, then we can talk about my personal responsibility to live for ever. In the meantime, let me eat cake.", "8||The Guardian view on blue plaques and banknotes: making women count\u201cRepresentation is what gets me worked up. It\u2019s important,\u201d the feminist writer and activist Caroline Criado Perez told the Observer earlier this year. A few days later, the statue of the suffragist Millicent Fawcett that she had campaigned for was unveiled in Parliament Square, where it joined 11 statues of men. Almost a year earlier, a statue of the Crimean war nurse Mary Seacole was unveiled in the gardens of St Thomas\u2019 hospital, half a mile away on the opposite side of the Thames. Then, in September last year, a new \u00a310 note went into circulation featuring the novelist Jane Austen \u2013 following another campaign by Ms Criado Perez, who threatened to take the Bank of England to court after it decided to replace an image of the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill, meaning that there would have been no women represented on English bank notes \u2013 apart from the Queen. The Bank appears to have learned its lesson. On Friday it invited members of the public to submit suggestions as to which scientist should appear on the new \u00a350 note, with the mathematician Ada Lovelace and the Nobel prize-winning chemist Dorothy Hodgkin among early frontrunners. Earlier in the week English Heritage asked people to nominate women whose lives could be celebrated with a blue plaque on a London building. At 14%, the proportion of blue plaques currently dedicated to women is \u201cfar too low\u201d, the organisation said. Efforts at boosting women\u2019s representation on monuments and in public spaces are not confined to London. Campaigners in Dorset are fundraising for a statue of the fossil hunter Mary Anning in Lyme Regis. A statue of the suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst will be unveiled in Manchester in December. In York, a consultation is under way with a view to changing the wording on a rainbow plaque celebrating the diarist Anne Lister, so that she is described as a lesbian. Not everyone is convinced that such undertakings are worth the effort and the money, particularly at a time when so many women have been affected by reductions in public spending. Analysis of tax and benefit changes last year found that government cuts have cost women \u00a379bn since 2010, against \u00a313bn for men. Despite the introduction of new rules for reporting on the gender pay gap, the gulf between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hourly pay has not shrunk for three years. Meanwhile the hopes raised by #MeToo, that violence and harassment of women in the workplace could be dramatically reduced, have faded. Haven\u2019t feminists got more serious battles to fight than over statues and banknotes, it has been asked. Other voices question whether it is even desirable to perpetuate a model whereby prominent individuals and their deeds are celebrated, while more ordinary lives and struggles are forgotten. But representation is important, perhaps particularly to children in the process of forming their ideas about the world, and themselves. Positive role models \u2013 in real life or bronze \u2013 won\u2019t eliminate inequality. But it makes a difference to all of us who we see on plinths, screens, stamps and coins. That\u2019s why it matters that women of all sorts \u2013 black, white, lesbian, trans, disabled \u2013 are represented in all sorts of ways, in all sorts of places. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2018. An earlier version referred to British money when English money was meant. This has been corrected.", "15||Tim Berners-Lee launches campaign to save the web from abuseTim Berners-Lee has launched a global campaign to save the web from the destructive effects of abuse and discrimination, political manipulation, and other threats that plague the online world.

The contract outlines central principles that will be built into a full contract and published in May 2019, when half of the world\u2019s population will be able to get online. More than 50 organisations have already signed the contract, which is published by Berners-Lee\u2019s World Wide Web Foundation alongside a report that calls for urgent action. \u201cFor many years there was a feeling that the wonderful things on the web were going to dominate and we\u2019d have a world with less conflict, more understanding, more and better science, and good democracy,\u201d Berners-Lee told the Guardian. \u201cBut people have become disillusioned because of all the things they see in the headlines.\u201d \u201cHumanity connected by technology on the web is functioning in a dystopian way. We have online abuse, prejudice, bias, polarisation, fake news, there are lots of ways in which it is broken. This is a contract to make the web one which serves humanity, science, knowledge and democracy,\u201d he said. Under the principles laid out in the document, which Berners-Lee calls a \u201cMagna Carta for the web\u201d, governments must ensure that its citizens have access to all of the internet, all of the time, and that their privacy is respected so they can be online \u201cfreely, safely and without fear.\u201d Meanwhile, companies commit to making the internet affordable and accessible to all; respecting consumer privacy and personal data; and developing technologies that ensure the web is \u201ca public good that puts people first\u201d. The contract acknowledges that internet users have their own part to play and calls for people to make web content that is \u201crich and relevant\u201d; to build communities that respect civil discourse and human dignity; and to fight for an open web that is \u201ca global public resource for people everywhere\u201d. The former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has added his signature to the contract. \u201cTim Berners-Lee has pinpointed one of the great human rights issues of our time and his proposal deserves worldwide support,\u201d he said. Berners-Lee concedes it will be hard to measure the success of the contract, which will be promoted through a campaign called #ForTheWeb. But he believes it will help steer conversations in governments and boardrooms, and give the public a means to hold the powerful to account. The powerful increasingly means the big tech firms. One of the early signatories to the contract, Facebook, has been fined by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office for its part in the Cambridge Analytica scandal; has faced threats from the EU for taking too long to remove extremist content; and has been sued for allowing advertisers to target housing ads only at white people. The firm, which has appointed the former deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, to lead its PR operation, did not respond to a request for comment. Another early signatory, Google, is reportedly developing a censored version of its search engine for the Chinese market. \u201cIf you sign up to the principles, you can\u2019t do censorship,\u201d said Berners-Lee. \u201cWill this be enough to make search engines push back? Will it be persuasive enough for the Chinese government to be more open? I can\u2019t predict whether that will happen,\u201d he said. Google did not respond to a request for comment. Jonathan Zittrain, a law professor at Harvard University and author of The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It said: \u201cTo me, the most important function of the contract is to remind people that the web we have isn\u2019t the only one possible. That\u2019s both a warning \u2013 including about how aspects of the web have become \u2013 and an opportunity. The contract seeks to get those wielding the most power online to commit to some boundaries in how they treat their users.\u201d Cloudflare, an internet security firm, has also signed up. \u201cWe believe it offers an important opportunity to step back and examine the responsibilities we all have to make sure the web delivers on its promise,\u201d a spokesperson said. Roya Mahboob, founder of the Afghan Girls Robotics Club and member of The NewNow, said: \u201cThe contract for the web comes at a perfect time for women and girls around the world to speak truth to power, call out injustice and seize new opportunities. The contract means a real commitment to dignity, justice and equality from governments, companies and citizens. This idea can be quite revolutionary for the future of the web.\u201d Some online ills can be traced back to the reliance of certain businesses on advertising, with the pursuit of better revenues spawning clickbait and fake news. But Berners-Lee said companies are looking at how to combat those, and sees other reasons to be hopeful: \u201cPeople in the big companies are concerned about truth and democracy. They don\u2019t want people to look back and say theirs was the platform that misled people to vote against their own best interests,\u201d he said. \u201cThe genie may seem to have come out of the bottle, but the internet has surprised us many times,\u201d he added. \u201cThings change.\u201d", "7||Let\u2019s have perspective in tuition fees debateDanny Dorling is entitled to criticise the current university funding system, and I am by no means a fan of the marketisation agenda. But he gets carried away (How to write off student debt: my message for Labour, 30 October). Have fees really turned \u201ceducation into a cheap and nasty marketplace\u201d? Words and tone really do matter. If Dorling has evidence to back up his assertions, I hope he has shared it with the Office for Students and the Competition and Markets Authority. If he shares it with me I will certainly pass it on. Sensationalised comments are particularly unhelpful given that universities are founded upon intellectual rigour. If Danny Dorling \u2013 the Halford Mackinder professor of human geography at Oxford University \u2013 does not need to base his conclusions on evidence, on what grounds can any of us in the university sector defend the importance of what we do? If Danny Dorling can say whatever suits his argument, how can we object when Donald Trump does the same? The public have become sceptical of experts. One reason is that too many have used the platform their position gives them to indulge their prejudices. By all means criticise the university funding system, but do so with argument and reason. Professor Graham Galbraith Vice-chancellor, University of Portsmouth \u2022 Danny Dorling is right to identify current students and recent graduates as big losers following the coalition government\u2019s decision to triple university fees in England. Politicians must deal not just with the future cost of university, but also address the record debt levels created by the 2010 reforms. Research by London Economics for the University and College Union found that graduates will be hit with a \u201cmidlife tax crisis\u201d because of their massive student loan debts. This is just one symptom of a great crisis in education created by the government\u2019s policies, which see the provision of learning as a cost not a public good. Our higher education funding system is off-putting for the poorest and those who wish to study part-time. It needs urgent surgery, as does further education, where colleges currently make do with 21% less real-terms funding than in 2010. If the UK is to have a future as a high-skill economy, rather than a tax haven for the rich, we need a coherent plan, an increase in investment and an acknowledgement that education is integral to our society and economy, not an optional extra. Matt Waddup Head of policy and campaigns, University and College Union \u2022 Danny Dorling\u2019s plan to cap university fees looks ingenious. But how about the circa 3 million other students for whom this does nothing, other than absorb a very large amount of public subsidy, a small part of which might otherwise have been available to them? I refer to all those studying in further and adult education. They generally come from poorer backgrounds, so if we want progressive public expenditure we should be focusing on them. Their courses are often life-changingly effective in equipping them with all kinds of skills, personal and vocational. And in an ageing society this sector caters for students of all ages. Yet public funding for it has declined by 25% in the last few years. The Association of Colleges has recently been vocal in making the case for colleges. Some of us have argued independently for an entitlement that applies equally to students in higher and further/adult education. Is there any argument against such equity? Rarely does anyone disagree in public. I\u2019m sure Danny Dorling agrees. Getting practical action to achieve a proper balance is another matter. We await the results of the independent review of post-18 funding, chaired by Philip Augar, with interest. Professor Tom Schuller London \u2022 Student tuition fees raise their head yet again, complete with the myth of students suffering under a huge financial burden. This time it is Danny Dorling who sets out an ingenious solution. Unfortunately, there is a huge flaw in Dorling\u2019s argument because the more the state provides for tuition fees, the more help is given to better-off students. At the moment, because no student pays anything while at university and only begins to pay at all when earning above \u00a325,000 \u2013 and then only a percentage of the sum above that figure \u2013 poorer students pay little or nothing. Danny Dorling talks of \u201conerous private debts\u201d, but all that is onerous is a psychological burden, engendered by constant repetition of misinformation for political motives. He would be better off campaigning against the high rate of interest attached to the loans, reminding students that any outstanding amount is written off after 30 years and that student loans cannot be taken into account by mortgage providers. All in all it is a good deal, certainly better than under Labour. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds \u2022 It is a sad day when Danny Dorling is prepared to back Labour\u2019s proposal to scrap university fees and eliminate the existing student loans. That proposal in Labour\u2019s manifesto was politically motivated and has no connection with economic justice and the need to reduce the high level of inequality. The present student loan scheme is not perfect and can be improved, but overall it is one of the fairest pieces of legislation introduced in an otherwise barren landscape over the past 20 years. There is no better guarantee of financial and social wellbeing than the possession of a university degree, and it is right and fair that those who benefit should pay the costs of providing that benefit, rather than imposing the cost through higher taxes or reduced public services for those not so fortunate. The average university graduate has an average income after taxes, national insurance and student loan repayments 50% higher than those who have only completed their GCSEs. The gap is greater when we look at those who have not completed school. The reference to loans of \u00a350,000 is an emotional rather than rational way of attacking the system. Such so-called loans are no more genuine loans than is the future tax which any citizen can expect to pay over the rest of their life. The student loan scheme effectively is a form of graduate tax, but has advantages over such a tax.

True representation of the diversity of the UK isn\u2019t just about what we see on our screens but also the people writing, directing, filming and working behind the camera. Over the years some of the most important British films and television have been written and directed by Britain\u2019s talented female, BAME and disabled creatives including the award-winning Amma Asante, Sally Wainwright, Gurinder Chadha, Abi Morgan, Steve McQueen, Sharon Horgan and Michaela Coel. They enrich the creativity of the UK and add to our cultural heritage, but unfortunately they continue to be the exception rather than the rule. We believe the implementation of a representation tax relief is necessary because diversity in important sections of the UK film and television industry is in crisis: \u2022 A report by Directors UK revealed only 2.31% of UK television is made by directors of BAME background. \u2022 According to the British Film Institute, only 3% of the UK film industry\u2019s production and post-production workforce are from a BAME background. \u2022 Over the last decade women made up only 13.6% of working film directors in the UK, despite making up the majority of film students. \u2022 Only 0.3% of the total UK film workforce and 4.5% of the television workforce are disabled, well short of the 18% in the population who consider themselves disabled. These numbers are shocking. Tax relief is a tried and tested mechanism to increase employment and activity in the UK film industry. We believe a representation tax relief would encourage investment in diverse film and television productions, boost the growth of UK film and television productions directed, written and filmed by disabled people, women and BAME background people. It would also increase the level of diversity in the industry workforce. A report by the BFI showed that spend on film production in the UK reached the highest level on record in 2017 with \u00a31.9bn, a 12% increase on the previous year and total UK expenditure on high-end television in 2017 was \u00a3938m, an increase from \u00a3861m in 2016. Employment in film and video production has also grown year on year, according to the BFI, at a considerably faster rate than the rest of the economy, and a large part of this success and growth has been attributed to the government\u2019s film and TV tax credits schemes. Importantly, in recent years, the UK film and TV tax relief scheme has been adapted to focus on areas such as children\u2019s animation. Kay Benbow, then head of BBC CBeebies channel said tax relief \u201ctipped the balance\u201d for productions that otherwise would not have been commissioned. We believe boosting diversity in UK film and TV should benefit from the same incentives. A representation tax relief would give UK film and television productions tax relief if they meet three of the four following criteria: (1) The director is a woman and/or disabled and/or from a BAME background. (2) The writer is a woman and/or disabled and/or from a BAME background. (3) The director of photography is a woman and/or disabled and/or from a BAME background. (4) 50% of staff spend behind the camera is on female staff, or 14% on BAME staff, or 18% on disabled staff. Complaints over the lack of diversity in the creative industries have seen things slowly begin to change, but the time has come for more substantive measures, and real change needs to be underwritten by law. The measures we are calling for are long overdue and will ensure the UK has the most diverse and vibrant film and television industries in the world.

Surprisingly, sales of melatonin are not regulated and it is widely available as an over-the-counter medication and from online retailers. This means the real number of children taking melatonin may well be higher than quoted in your report. The rise in melatonin prescriptions coincides with the increased use of blue-rich LED lighting in our indoor and outdoor spaces and the increased use of LED screens. In a previous article, the Guardian reported that the rise in children\u2019s sleeplessness was partly down to technology and the fact that the blue light from LED screens suppresses the production of the sleep hormone, making it harder to fall asleep. In the opinion of LightAware, sleeplessness will continue to be a huge problem in children until we reduce the excessive amount of blue light in our environment. It is surely better to tackle the causes of the problem than expose children to untested medication. Dr John Lincoln and Eleanor Levin LightAware Trustees \u2022 The rise in the number of children being prescribed melatonin is no doubt, in part, related to increasing numbers being given medications to manage their ADHD, which in turn disrupts their sleep. However, it is worth remembering that not only humans produce melatonin. Some years ago research from Finland suggested that cows milked before dawn had higher levels of melatonin in their milk. This led to many supermarkets selling melatonin-enriched milk. The old adage of having a milky drink before bedtime probably had a kernel of truth.

Ten years later I moved on and became instrumental in extending its ideas through the establishment of the Fairtrade Foundation. It took a further 10 years for the Fairtrade mark to become widely known as guaranteeing a better deal for producers on mainstream products such as tea, coffee, sugar and chocolate. In that period Traidcraft concentrated on building innovative relationships with small-scale, non-commodity producers and also continued to grow in size. There has always been a tension between the cost of implementing the aspirational ethics of a minority of affluent consumers and the desire of disadvantaged producers to get a better price for their products and, especially, to sell more. Fortunately, the public is now well served by many thousands of reasonably priced Fairtrade-marked products, in retail stores large and small. These deliver tangible benefits and a cash premium to producer groups around the world.

Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee, criticised the decision to put off the stake reduction until October next year, citing a warning from the former sports minister Tracey Crouch \u2013 who resigned over the delay last week \u2013 that two people take their lives every day due to gambling addiction. \u201cIt is the case that the government has prioritised the preservation of jobs in the gambling industry over the addiction of those who suffer from these machines,\u201d she said. Morgan quoted from the government\u2019s own assessment of the policy\u2019s impact, published in May, which indicated that bookmakers needed up to 12 months to prepare, which would allow for implementation in May 2019. In an appearance before the committee on Tuesday, Hammond said he had not read the document. Crouch\u2019s resignation is understood to have been triggered by a belief that party colleagues, including pro-gambling MP Philip Davies, went over her head to secure a longer transition period. Hammond said: \u201cI have no love for these machines; I think they are terrible things.\u201d But he said the gambling industry had told him that between 15,000 and 21,000 jobs would be lost due to curbs on FOBTs, from which bookmakers derive more than half of their annual revenues, around \u00a31.8bn a year. The October 2019 implementation date amounted to a \u201csensible compromise\u201d that would allow for an orderly transition, Hammond said. \u201cThe trouble with that very rational analysis [\u2026] is that it doesn\u2019t really help the expected 300 people who may end up taking their lives, suffering mental health problems from gambling addiction,\u201d said Morgan. Asked by Labour MP Alison McGovern about a Guardian report that an early draft of the budget envisaged an April 2019 implementation date, before being removed at the last minute, Hammond said he was unaware of whether this was the case. \u201cI\u2019m not involved in the drafting of documents by officials within the Treasury,\u201d he said, adding that he was not aware of any earlier draft. The circumstances surrounding the timing of the stake reduction have been hotly disputed since the resignation of Crouch, who launched the government review of gambling regulation that led to the decision. The furore over FOBTs has left the government facing the prospect of a cross-party amendment to the finance bill, which Crouch has said she would support now that she was no longer a junior minister. Morgan said the FOBT decision had caused an \u201cunnecessary row with the House at the time when the government needs all the friends in the House it can have\u201d. The chancellor also downgraded the importance of eliminating the budget deficit, arguing that there was a need to balance growing the economy with generating a surplus for the public finances. Hammond said that the deficit, which is the gap between tax receipts and government spending, would shrink to about 0.8% of GDP by 2023-24 compared with 10% in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago. While that would put the Conservatives on course to miss their manifesto promise to balance the books by the mid-2020s, he said the government would be in \u201ctouching distance\u201d, and added that it would be for future fiscal events to balance the need between cutting the deficit, reducing taxes, increasing spending on public services and investing in infrastructure. In a statement that is likely to be seen as justification of Labour\u2019s approach to fixing the public finances during the last recession, when George Osborne stuck to the policy of imposing cuts to balance the books rather than investing in the economy, Hammond said that growing the economy was the \u201csmart way\u201d to reduce Britain\u2019s national debt, rather than focusing too much on cutting the deficit.", "13||Northern Irish woman to challenge abortion prosecutionA woman who is facing prosecution for obtaining abortion pills for her pregnant underage daughter is due to challenge the move in a potential legal landmark for Northern Ireland\u2019s criminalisation of abortion. The woman will appear in a Belfast court on Tuesday to seek to overturn a decision by the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland to subject her to a criminal trial and the prospect of five years in prison for supplying the pills in 2013 to her then 15-year-old daughter, who terminated the pregnancy. The woman, who has not been named, is accused of two charges of unlawfully procuring and supplying abortion pills contrary to the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. The judicial review is the first time prosecutors have faced a direct challenge over a decision relating to the criminalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland. A hearing in September was adjourned to allow prosecutors to make a formal submission to the high court in Belfast on the human rights implications of the case in the wake of a supreme court ruling. \u201cThis case is the first ever direct challenge to a prosecution under Northern Ireland\u2019s restrictive abortion law,\u201d Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International\u2019s Northern Ireland campaign manager, said in a statement. Amnesty is supporting the woman and her legal team. \u201cAll this mother has done is help her daughter access abortion pills that are prescribed free on the NHS in every other part of the UK,\u201d said Teggart. \u201cThis is an obvious and cruel injustice. This woman has done nothing wrong and yet our laws treat her as a criminal. It\u2019s unacceptable that she has had to suffer and endure five distressing years of legal battles and a fight against a prison sentence.\u201d In a statement released in September the woman said she had endured \u201cfive years of agony\u201d with the prosecution hanging over her and her family. \u201cThe fear and pain of it all. I feel like I am not allowed to move on. The only place I feel safe and I can speak is in work, because it\u2019s anonymous and I have a distraction.\u201d She said she had lost all trust in doctors and no longer used their services because it was her GP who alerted police to the case. MPs in Westminster last month voted by 207 to 117 in favour of an amendment forcing the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, \u201cto issue guidance\u201d to explain how officials can continue to enforce the region\u2019s Victorian-era abortion law. The vote was largely symbolic as it is unclear how much impact the amendment would have on existing practice. The NHS does not provide abortions in Northern Ireland, forcing women who live there to travel to Great Britain to obtain terminations.", "8||It\u2019s clear: the Tories still don\u2019t think poor people need an educationUniversities, the Conservative MP Robert Halfon has warned, are \u201cobsessed with academic degrees\u201d; these degrees do not prepare students for the workplace, where nobody cares how much TS Eliot you can quote. Consequently, they represent poor value for money, in a marketplace where students have been sold their debt on the basis of its future wage returns.

Unless students could be persuaded that their degrees would net them well in excess of \u00a327k when it came to earnings, the offer would have been much simpler: you can\u2019t have what generations before you had, because \u2026 tough. Unfortunately, it was never true: the figures given by universities minister Jo Johnson last year were that a graduate woman would earn \u00a3250,000 more over her lifetime than her non-graduate counterpart, a graduate man \u00a3170,000 more. The original modelling for the student loan book was based on an average \u00a3150,000 gap over a lifetime and didn\u2019t take into account the fact that some would earn much more than that, yet still repay only their loan, while others would earn much less and never be in a position to repay. Put more simply, whatever you think of the debt burden landed out of nowhere upon a generation, the public purse would be much better served by progressive taxation. But that\u2019s a niggle for another day. The reality is that many students are taking degrees in which they will never secure work, high paid or otherwise. A Leeds councillor once told me there were more photography students in his city than there were photography jobs in the whole of Europe. The Royal Society published a report in 2010 that mentioned, almost in passing, that the proportion of Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) postgraduates who would end up with professorships was 0.45%. I mention science and photography simply because they are considered vocational: it is so embedded in the humanities experience that you\u2019d never get a job in it (whether Egyptology or English; history or theology) that nobody would even bother to commission research. Before the Dearing report in 1997, nobody tried to monetise learning on an individual basis; higher education was accepted as a public good. Post-Dearing, the goal was for everyone to get a degree, and a crucial element of that was for the state to stop bearing the cost, since that was \u201cdesigned in the 1950s for an elite system\u201d. Only the elite are worth spending money on, in other words: once everyone else came rushing in, the market should provide. Like any argument that has its arse on backwards, these assumptions failed: there was never any guarantee that a degree would proceed, uninterrupted, to a relevant and suitably remunerated job. Subsequent pressures \u2013 principally, stagnant wages and the growth of unpaid work at professional entry level, have rendered ridiculous the notion that graduates would be rewarded for the financial risks they were taking. The tragedy is, those who recognise this are punished: I interviewed an ex-student in Liverpool just before the 2015 election. He\u2019d dropped out of a business studies degree in the south becauseeven after the rudimentary lessons he learnt in the first two terms, he couldn\u2019t see any way to justify spending \u00a39,000 on information he could quite easily peel off the internet. This left him with the debt of that first year, no degree, and the unenviable status of Neet. Student debt is like the climax of Toy Story 3: a conveyor belt from which you can\u2019t alight, even if you can see a roaring furnace of impecunity at the end of it. There is nothing less surprising than the surge of anxiety in university life, so pronounced that some campuses even have petting zoos for exam time, emotional support dogs (and horses. And rabbits!)attempting, with their big eyes, to fill the gap between what students are required to believe and what they know to be true. Halfon is entirely correct: for a party that understands nothing but the market, the value of learning will always be a puzzle unless you can count it in pounds (though not for their own children, of course, for whom they can always see the poetry of learning Classics for its own sake). The underlying problem is a politics of superiority, in which the poor aren\u2019t worth educating, because if they had fine minds they wouldn\u2019t be poor. Universities, with their academic obsessions, their erudite, philosophical bent, should concentrate on overturning that. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 9 November 2018 to reinstate the full list of Stem subjects; technology and engineering were lost in the editing process.", "0||Hundreds in hiding as Tanzania launches anti-gay crackdownHundreds of LGBT activists in Tanzania have gone into hiding after a senior official announced a taskforce aiming to identify and punish gay people in Dar es Salaam. Paul Makonda, the city\u2019s administrative head, said he had put together a team of officials and police that would target gay people, who could face lengthy prison sentences, in an intensification of anti-LGBT discrimination. In an interview posted on YouTube, Makonda called for Tanzanians to report gay people and told a news conference he had already received more than 5,700 messages from the public, including more than 100 names. One LGBT activist, speaking to the Guardian from Dar es Salaam on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cThey are raiding houses. It is a horrible thing. It is just going to get worse. So many people are leaving the city, running away. They are targeting the activists, saying we are promoting homosexuality. We have to hide.\u201d Another activist in the city described the atmosphere as \u201copen season on gay people\u201d and reported lists of names being published on social media to \u201cout people\u201d. \u201cYou can imagine what that is doing to people, to families,\u201d he said. The Tanzanian foreign ministry has said Makonda\u2019s campaign represents his own views and not the official government position. But officials have repeatedly backed a series of homophobic measures since John Magufuli became president in 2015 on an anti-graft platform. Campaign groups have accused Tanzania of following a \u201cdangerous path\u201d. The country also faces growing criticism over alleged human rights abuses. Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International\u2019s regional director for east Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes, said: \u201cThe idea of this taskforce \u2026 serves to incite hatred among members of the public. LGBTI people in Tanzania already face discrimination, threats and attacks without hateful statements of this kind.\u201d Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said she feared \u201ca witch-hunt [which] could be interpreted as a licence to carry out violence, intimidation, bullying, harassment and discrimination against those perceived to be LGBT\u201d. In 2016, Tanzania banned nongovernmental organisations from distributing free lube to gay people as part of efforts to control the spread of HIV/Aids, even though some health experts warned shutting down such outreach programmes could put the wider population at higher risk of infection. In a raid last year, at least 12 men were arrested at a Dar es Salaam hotel at a gathering that authorities said was to promote same-sex relationships. Homosexuality remains taboo across much of Africa and gay people face discrimination or persecution, with human rights groups often reluctant to speak publicly in defence of gay rights. A conviction for having \u201ccarnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature\u201d can lead to 30 years or more in jail in Tanzania. Two opposition leaders were sentenced to five months in prison in February for insulting Magufuli, and a Tanzanian opposition leader was charged on Friday with sedition and inciting hatred, days after he said scores died in clashes between security forces and herders in his western home district, a statement that was dismissed by authorities. Zitto Kabwe, a frequent government critic, told a news conference on Sunday that at least 100 people died during clashes in Kigoma in mid-October. He was detained three days later, then charged in court on Friday and released on a 10 million shilling (\u00a33,400) bond, his Alliance for Change and Transparency party said. Kigoma\u2019s police commander, Martin Ottieno, told Reuters that two herders and two officers had died during an operation to stop the former keeping livestock illegally on a government-owned ranch. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2018 to clarify the length of the jail sentence in Tanzania for \u201ccarnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature\u201d.", "16||A 13-year-old girl is a \u2018lesbian\u2019 if she plays football? Some things don\u2019t changeWhen I was in school a few decades ago, it was standard to be called a lesbian if you so much as kicked a football back to a boy in the playground. This was obviously after the ball had been aimed at one\u2019s (lesbo) head in the kind of terrifying gesture that we were taught, as girls, to laugh off \u2013 or, worse, take as a compliment. (See also: the pinging of bra straps.) Well, here we are in 2018, which in many ways is just an endless gif of a football whacking your outraged teenage head (which \u2013 ha! \u2013 in my case turned out to be bisexual), and a 13-year-old girl is being called a lesbian \u2026 for playing football. Some things, such as the nature and content of homophobic taunts, don\u2019t change. Darcie, from Monmouthshire in Wales, has reportedly been told by PE teachers that she cannot play football as a recommended sport at school. Her peers \u201chave criticised me a lot by saying I\u2019m a man or a lesbian\u201d, she says. The other children\u2019s parents are reportedly no better, apparently shouting \u201cdon\u2019t let a girl tackle you\u201d during matches. Gender stereotyping never looked so unoriginal. What starts in the playground ends up the rule in a world where women\u2019s events make up a paltry 7% of all UK sports coverage. Then there is the recreational world, where golf remains the preserve of men and women do less exercise. What we\u2019re really talking about is health inequality. Then there is the matter of what women are doing while men are playing football with their mates at the weekend. At a guess? Childcare and domestic work. Anyone who is bringing up children or has walked past a playground or weekend kickabout in their local park will have clocked the vast outnumbering of boys playing football while a vast outnumbering of dads shout encouragement; the separating of primary school girls and boys for sports days; the conspicuous lack of girls and, for that matter, black and Asian children. The veneration of conventionality has always been the way of school life, stultifying for so many of us, but gender stereotyping and segregation in sport continues to be completely unacknowledged. Which is how you get dated, embarrassing stuff happening, like England\u2019s national governing body for swimming offering guidance to women on the best costume for flabby stomachs, pear shapes, boyish bodies and large or small busts. In 2018. In schools and sports clubs across the country, it\u2019s as if #thisgirlcan never happened.", "8||My question to pro-Europe MPs: will you take on the Brexit conmen?Brexit expresses a part of what it means to be British, albeit not the part anyone who campaigned for it had in mind. It is the national tendency to find satisfaction in being dissatisfied. It is the spirit of picnics in the rain and self-congratulation for having stuck with a plan long after it stopped making sense. It looks increasingly plausible that Theresa May will complete a deal that pleases no one and is approved by parliament anyway. The outline is coming into focus. To keep the Irish border friction-free, the UK will be locked into maximal regulatory alignment with Brussels. There will be some dodgy escape clause, sold to Tory Eurosceptics as a future portal to the mythical global trade utopia of Canada-plus. That model would be too soft for the hard nuts and too hard for the softies. It would launch the UK into an outer-European orbit without a seat at mission control. It would be worse than EU membership, but less wantonly self-destructive than breaking off the talks and running at next March\u2019s cliff edge. Some Tory cliff-jumpers (with their own private financial parachutes) will reject any deal. Their number is uncertain but probably enough for Downing Street to need votes from Labour MPs who like neither Brexit nor May. Why should they, or the pro-European Tories who agree with them, bail the prime minister out? The answer is fear \u2013 of no-deal chaos and of constituents who just want out; no quibbling over terms and conditions. The sole merit in May\u2019s model will be its availability. It will be an Angus Steakhouse of Brexits \u2013 the uninspiring place you end up in because it\u2019s there, and you\u2019re hungry and tired of walking in circles looking for an elusive destination to satisfy everyone in your party. The alternative is to hold out for something better at the risk of getting something worse. Here the pro-European camp splits. On one side are those who say the only way to avoid the pointless cost of Brexit is by calling it off, which requires another referendum. On the other side are those who see the social impact of a referendum as costlier than the economic hit of an orderly Brexit. They flinch at the thought of a campaign that, judging by recent precedent, would be neither civil, nor decisive. This debate among former remainers is now the most important battle in British politics, and it transcends traditional party allegiance. It centres not on whether leaving the EU is a good idea but on whether it has to be done anyway, in diluted form, as the fare for moving the nation on. The dilemma: gamble on a people\u2019s vote, reigniting a horrible culture war with no guarantee of victory, or concede defeat with the consolation prize of a customs union. Another referendum is a tough sell when people can still taste the bitterness of the last one. Yes, there is a difference between a leap in the dark and informed consent based on a concrete proposal. The 2016 poll was held in a fog of ignorance and misinformation. Allegations of fraud in the financing of the pro-Brexit machine are reason enough for some to demand a rematch. But the reluctant Brexiters worry that remain arguments still sound condescending to many leavers\u2019 ears. The remain message is vulnerable to caricature as a sneer that stupid racists got the question wrong and must resit the exam until they give the right answer. Millions of voters saw Brexit as a once-per-generation demand for change, unique and irreversible. If MPs are thinking of reversing it, they\u2019d better have a bloody good sense of what they are offering instead. Anything that looks like restoration of a Westminster ancien r\u00e9gime could stoke a rage to shake the foundations of British democracy. But a backlash is not averted by going through with Brexit. There is no chance of May\u2019s deal meeting every (or any) advertised benefit of quitting the EU, so those who missold the adventure will start parcelling out blame, directing none at themselves. Remainers might fear reopening painful divisions, but Brexiteers have shown no interest in national healing. Theirs is the Trumpesque politics of salting wounds and scoring the howls of pain into nationalist marching songs. Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nigel Farage, Arron Banks \u2013 these are cowards who flee responsibility for decisions they urge on others. They long ago renounced ownership of any practical Brexit outcome. It was never their intention to preside over the enactment of their mendacious campaigns and it is not their intention to lay down arms once the UK is out of the EU. They look forward to the day when May\u2019s model has failed so they can steer the ensuing grievance towards scapegoats closer to home than Brussels. Here, then, are some questions for pro-Europeans who do not want to face the Brexit conmen in another referendum: do you really think Johnson-Faragism is an unbeatable proposition or will you dare to take it on? When? If you surrender the trench of EU membership, where do you retreat to fight again? If you let Brexit pass because you were afraid to argue from principle that it is a mistake, what will your argument be when the mistake is found out? The temptation to settle for anything the prime minister brings home will be great. The lure of a return to politics that isn\u2019t about Europe is strong. It is also a mirage. Hard leavers will hate May\u2019s deal, but they will be relaxed if former remainers want to pull the trigger that kills EU membership. Those suckers will own the terms of Brexit without ever having believed in the goal. Then the people who should most take responsibility for the mess that follows will laugh as they heap blame on the MPs who thought it was a bad idea and, for reasons history will struggle to admire, did it anyway. \u2022Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist", "2||Spanking children makes them more aggressive, US pediatricians' body saysNew guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics has found that children who are spanked by their parents are more likely to develop aggressive behaviors and are at an increased risk of mental health disorders. In a policy statement updating its advice on effective ways to discipline children, the AAP said parents should also avoid \u201cverbal abuse\u201d which could cause \u201cshame or humiliation\u201d. \u201cAversive disciplinary strategies, including all forms of corporal punishment and yelling at or shaming children, are minimally effective in the short-term and not effective in the long-term,\u201d the AAP said. \u201cResearchers link corporal punishment to an increased risk of negative behavioral, cognitive, psychosocial, and emotional outcomes for children.\u201d The AAP had previously discouraged spanking in a 1998 policy statement, but the new report goes further in examining the ways in which spanking is detrimental. The updated report, which offers guidance to pediatricians in the US, brings together dozens of studies into the effectiveness of corporal punishment \u2013 defined as \u201cnon-injurious, open handed hitting with the intention of modifying child behavior\u201d. It cited a 2014 study that found the effects of corporal punishment were \u201ctransient\u201d \u2013 within 10 minutes of being punished 73% of children surveyed had \u201cresumed the same behavior for which they had been punished\u201d. Another study monitored about 5,000 children, from 20 large US cities, between the age of one and nine years old. It found that children \u201cwho were spanked more than twice a month were more aggressive at subsequent surveys\u201d. \u201cChildren who experience repeated use of corporal punishment tend to develop more aggressive behaviors, increased aggression in school, and an increased risk of mental health disorders and cognitive problems,\u201d said Dr Robert D Sege, lead author of the AAP statement. \u201cIn cases where warm parenting practices occurred alongside corporal punishment, the link between harsh discipline and adolescent conduct disorder and depression remained.\u201d Instead, adults should reinforce appropriate behaviors, set limits, redirect children and set expectations. The AAP suggests that instead of spanking, parents should use \u201cpositive reinforcement as a primary means of teaching acceptable behavior\u201d. \u201cFor example, parents can learn that young children crave attention, and telling a child, \u2018I love it when you \u2026\u2019 is an easy means of reinforcing desired behavior,\u201d the association advises. It also recommends using a \u201ctime-out\u201d when a child breaks a specific rule. \u201cOne minute per year of age is a good rule of thumb,\u201d the AAO says.", "10||No additional checks on EU employees required, says immigration ministerThe immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, has confirmed that employers will not have to make any additional checks on EU nationals to determine whether they have the right to work in the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit. She was instructed to appear before MPs after causing confusion over whether businesses would have to establish the eligibility of their EU workers. During a session before the home affairs committee last week, Nokes claimed that they would face \u201crigorous checks\u201d. Sajid Javid was forced to wade into the row to reassure businesses, which reacted with dismay to the remarks. The home secretary told them that they would not be expected to do \u201canything different than they do today\u201d. The government\u2019s immigration policy has come under intense scrutiny as the date that the UK leaves the EU creeps closer, with ministers yet to reveal what system they will adopt beyond Theresa May repeatedly saying that free movement would come to an end. A clearly flustered Nokes, in response to an urgent question from Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, confirmed: \u201cEmployers will have to continue checking passports or ID cards as they do now for both EU and British citizens. We will not be asking employers to differentiate even if there is no deal.\u201d She repeatedly told MPs pressing for more detail that further clarity on the settled status scheme would follow \u201cin due course\u201d and that a long-promised immigration bill would finally be published \u201cvery shortly\u201d. \u201cThe prime minister has been very clear: free movement will end and we will in due course set out the immigration system which will enable further clarity,\u201d she said, adding that more than 1,000 people \u2013 0.03% of the total number of EU citizens in the UK \u2013 had already been granted settled status. However, Nokes was unable to confirm the date on which free movement would end. \u201cIt is important to set out the timetable for ending free movement, but the prime minister has been very clear that we\u2019re going to do just that,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s obvious that the best solution is that these rights are enshrined in UK immigration law, which is what we\u2019re going to do \u2026 It is important that individuals are given as smooth a journey as possible through the process.\u201d She said EU citizens living and working in the UK \u201care part of our community and part of our country and we welcome the contribution they make\u201d. However, Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, accused Nokes of failing to clear up the confusion. \u201cI\u2019m none the wiser about what checks will apply for those EU citizens in the event of no deal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the clock ticking and there\u2019s only five months left. Surely the Home Office has got a grip on these basic questions.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, warned of the \u201cvery real distress\u201d that had been caused to EU citizens in the UK. \u201cAs we move towards leaving the EU, this type of confusion over policy is simply unacceptable. It\u2019s not simply the good faith of government that she calls into question, it\u2019s people\u2019s lives we\u2019re playing with.\u201d", "13||They shall not pasty: why British soldiers are banned from GreggsName: Greggs.

Well, in a document about dress and discipline obtained by the Mail on Sunday, troops in the Royal Dragoon Guards, stationed at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire, were warned not to smoke or text in public. And \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d should they \u201cstand outside Greggs eating a pasty\u201d, because it would \u201clook unprofessional\u201d. How about a sausage roll?

The increasing popularity of ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) videos, in which people listen to pleasing noises that act as sedatives (like the sound of someone eating a raw cauliflower) and \u201cmukbang\u201d \u2013 a combination of muok-da (the Korean word for eating) with bang song (Korean for broadcast) \u2013 have seen millions tuning in to YouTube videos to watch people eat. But are these online food communities just another short-lived fad, or could they have wider implications for the way we socialise? While eating a meal has traditionally been a communal affair, eating alone is becoming increasingly common as the number of single-person households grows. The government predicts the number of single-occupant households will reach 1.7 million in England by 2039. Is mukbang a symptom of our growing loneliness? \u201cLoneliness is such a personal experience, so it is difficult to say either way,\u201d says Alice Stride, a spokeswoman for the Campaign to End Loneliness. \u201cIt might bring someone great comfort to watch someone else prepare a meal and eat it, especially if they have been living on their own for a long time.\u201d Solo dining in restaurants is becoming more socially acceptable, too. According to the online reservation service Bookatable, single-table bookings have increased by 38% since 2014. Not everyone thinks this is a bad thing. A plethora of foodie bloggers can be found waxing lyrical on the joys of eating alone, invariably claiming that solo dining means you concentrate on your food rather than your dining partner. A recent report conducted by the Royal Voluntary Service charity found that one in five people over 70 eat most meals alone. Stride adds that she would be concerned if younger people were watching people eat instead of eating with friends or family, but recognises that for older people the television can be a huge source of comfort. Stride adds: \u201cIf you can\u2019t get out, if you\u2019re ill for example, then perhaps that would bring you a great sense of comfort.

GW Over in Brussels, eurozone finance minister are urging Italy to compromise in the row over its 2019 budget. My colleague Jennifer Rankin reports: Several eurozone finance ministers have come out to back Brussels in a row with Italy\u2019s populist government over a budget that has been deemed to break the rules of the common currency bloc. France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the future of the euro was at stake as he urged the Italian government to reach an agreement with the European commission. \u201cThe wise path is the path of dialogue, exchange of views, to find the best solution for the eurozone as a whole, for the Italian government and for our common currency,\u201d he said on Monday as he arrived at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers. \u201cFor what is at stake now is our common currency.\u201d More here: Economist Rupert Seggins has pulled together a neat Twitter thread on today\u2019s UK data: Here\u2019s Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics on the strong US service sector growth: October\u2019s reading was above the consensus forecast of 59.3. The modest decline was driven mainly by the business activity index, which fell from 65.2 to 62.5, and the employment index which dropped from 62.4 to 59.7. That said, the latter remains at a strong level by past standards and goes some way to explaining the 250,000 surge in non-farm payrolls last month. Encouragingly, the new orders index held up relatively well. America\u2019s service sector has posted another month of strong growth. The monthly US Services PMI report, from the US Institute of Supply Management, came in at 60.3, indicating output rose sharply again. That\u2019s down from September\u2019s 61.6, but still much better than the UK\u2019s service sector (which only managed a PMI of 52.2).

Earlier today the tech firm reported that CEO Ginni Rometty recently bought $3m worth of the company\u2019s stock; a sign of confidence in its prospects? The US market has made a mixed start to trading. While the Dow gained 75 points (0.3%) at the open, the Nasdaq dippped by 0.3%, as Apple shed 2%. Global markets are on edge today as investors brace for tomorrow\u2019s Midterm US elections. With Donald Trump and Barack Obama both in full-on campaign mode, turnout is likely to be high. Pollsters are pretty confident that the Democrats will take back control of the House of Representatives, while the Republicans will hold onto the Senate. But politics has a habit of springing surprises.... What might it all mean for the markets? Well, a Democrat-controlled House could start fresh investigations into Trump, and block further tax cuts and the unpicking of Obama\u2019s legacy. Mark Appleton, global head of multi-asset strategy at Ashburton Investments, thinks this could weaken the dollar, and the US stock market (something Trump\u2019s critics would see as a small price to pay!). Appleton says: Should the Democrats make significant gains in the House of Representatives, there is a high possibility recent US dollar strength will abate. Democrats are not proponents of President Donald Trump\u2019s low-tax regime and would likely frustrate plans for further cuts and deregulation, which have been recent drivers of the strong economy and currency. While a weaker US dollar would provide much needed relief for emerging markets, US equities may encounter some headwinds. Some economists, of course, think this is the wrong moment to be giving the US economy a sugar rush anyway. A quick recap. Growth across Britain\u2019s service sector companies has hit a seven-month low. Firms say new orders are drying up, as Brexit uncertainty hits confidence. In another blow, UK car sales declined in October too. Diesel sales slumped again. China\u2019s private sector also stumbled in October, with growth hitting its weakest in over two years. Economists fear that the trade war with America is now biting. Eurozone investors are getting gloomier too. Confidence has fallen in November, for the third month in a row. A runaway train has forced mining giant BHP Billiton to suspend rail operation in Western Australia. Any readers have a bad day at work can take comfort - at least you haven\u2019t lost control of a massive train full of iron ore. That\u2019s what happened to one poor driver employed by mining giant BHP Billiton in Western Australia. All was well, until the driver apparently got out of the train to check one of its 268 wagons. Next moment, the train was chugging along again, without human supervision.... After 92 kilometres, the train was deliberately derailed. BHP has now suspended rail operations in the region while it works out what went wrong.... UK insurance group Hiscox have fallen to the bottom of the FTSE 250 this morning, following its latest financial results. Hiscox disappointed investors by predicting that growth will slow in the next few months, following a challenging year dominated by US hurricanes, typhoons in Japan, and higher UK subsidence claims following the dry summer. Hiscox also revealed that it has spent $15m setting up a new European subsidiary, so it is prepared for Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. It says: Our preparations for Brexit are well advanced.... Our plans have always assumed a worst-case scenario \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 and we are prepared, irrespective of the outcome of the government\u2019s negotiations. Hiscox shares dropped by 6.9% this morning, to \u00a315.32. Here\u2019s our news story on the slowdown at Britain\u2019s service sector companies last month: European stock markets have shrugged off this morning\u2019s procession of bad news. The main indices remain flattish, while Italy\u2019s market is stuck in the red as the budget standoff between Rome and Brussels fizzles on. Overnight, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister insisted Rome\u2019s spending plans will become \u201ca recipe\u201d for reviving European growth, in a sign that Italy won\u2019t back down. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says investor sentiment has been shaken by those heavy losses in Asia overnight, and the slowdown in China\u2019s economy. The Caixin survey of Chinese service sector slipped to 50.8 \u2013 its lowest reading in one year. This adds weight to the argument that China\u2019s economy is cooling. Overnight, China\u2019s Xi Jinping talked about boosting global trade, and warned about the downside of protectionist policies, but the update failed to boost investor sentiment. The standoff between Italy and Brussels continues. The anti-establishment coalition in Rome are showing no signs of backing down regarding their plans to raise the budget deficit, and this is playing on investors mind\u2019s too. In another blow, eurozone investor confidence has fallen to a two-year low. Sentix, the German research group, reports that its eurozone investor morale index has dropped to just 8.8, from 11.4 in October. This is the third monthly decline in a row, and the lowest reading since November 2016. Manfred Huebner, managing director of Sentix, blames a range of factors. They include the US-China trade war, and the slowdown in car production as manufacturers scramble to meet new emissions tests. \u201cThe reasons for this development are manifold. There are external factors such as the U.S. president\u2019s trade policies as well as European issues. \u201cThe discussion about the future of the car industry in Germany, the weakness of the banking sector and the budget issue in Italy come to mind.\u201d Here\u2019s economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon on today\u2019s PMI report: Britain isn\u2019t the only economy which found October tough. Factories around the globe reported a slowdown in activity last month: Economists predict that the eurozone service-sector PMI (due tomorrow) will confirm that European firms struggled in October. The drop in UK service sector growth last month is \u201cthoroughly disappointing\u201d, says economist Howard Archer of EY Item Club. The slowdown in new business growth (to a 27-month low) \u201cbodes ill\u201d for future growth, Archer says, adding: Brexit uncertainties and concerns over the UK and global economies weighed on demand for business services. Additionally, demand for consumer services was reported to be subdued, which ties in with other signs that consumers reined in their spending at the start of the fourth quarter after splashing out over the summer Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange firm WorldFirst, says Brexit delays and wider fears over the global economic outlook are hurting UK service sector firms. He fears the situation will get worse, until the UK and EU reach an agreement. In another blow, business confidence across the services sector is its lowest since July 2016, today\u2019s PMI report shows. Firms are growing increasingly anxious about the risk of Brexit-related disruptions (predictions of long queues and delays at the ports if Britain leaves the EU without a deal) Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, blames the \u2018ambiguity\u2019 and lack of clarity around Brexit. \u201cA reluctance to commit was the message coming through loud and clear from service providers in October as the sector checked in with its worst performance since March and lowest optimism since July 2016. \u201cMany of the respondents attributed this poor performance and the biggest softening in new order growth since July 2016 to continuing ambiguity around the Brexit negotiations. There were also concerns over the weakness in the UK and global economies which affected client confidence and consumer spending. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says UK services companies are suffering badly from Brexit uncertainty. UK manufacturing growth hit a 25-month low in October (we learned last week), indicating the UK is only expanding sluggishly. Williamson explains: \u201cThe disappointing service sector numbers bring mounting evidence that Brexit worries are taking an increasing toll on the economy. Combined with the manufacturing and construction surveys, the October services PMI points to the economy growing at a quarterly rate of just 0.2%, setting the scene for GDP growth to weaken sharply in the fourth quarter. Brexit isn\u2019t the only problem, though... \u201ctrade wars, heightened geopolitical uncertainty and tightening financial market conditions\u201d are also weighing on the UK economy, Williamson adds. NEWSFLASH: Growth across Britain\u2019s service sector has slowed to a seven-month low. Service sector companies have reported that new business growth weakened in October, as nervous clients have cut back, according to data firm Markit. Consumer-facing sectors such as hotels, restaurants and leisure reported the weakest performance. A number of companies also cited Brexit-related uncertainties, and worries that the global economic outlook is deteriorating. Markit\u2019s Services PMI, which measures activity in the sector, fell to 52.2 in October from 53.9 in September -- the lowest reading since March. More to follow! Newsflash: British car sales have fallen again. Just 153,599 vehicles were registered in October, down 2.9% compared with a year earlier, according to figures released today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). That follows a 20% plunge in October. The SMMT says sales were hit by new, tougher, pollution rules introduced in Europe this summer. This has led to shortages of some models, as testing centres are fighting their way through a backlog of vehicles needing certification. Drivers continue to shun diesel, with sales down 21.3% year-on-year. Petrol sales rose 7%, while alternatively fuelled cars (electric) jumped by 30.7%. The big picture, though, is that UK car sales are 7% lower this year than in 2017. The pound has hit a two-week high against the US dollar, as the Brexit talks approach a climax. Britain is hoping to make progress on the thorny issue of the Northern Ireland Backstop this week, so that an emergency summit could be called before the end of November. Yesterday the Sunday Times claimed that PM Theresa May has a \u201csecret plan\u201d to keep the whole of Britain in a customs union, avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. But EU sources have told the Guardian that the two sides are still divided on crucial issues, meaning there\u2019s only a \u201c50-50\u201d chance of an agreement. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is also weighing in, calling May\u2019s proposals \u201can absolute stinker\u201d. He predicts MPs would vote them down, rather than agree to abide by EU rules during a post-Brexit transition period. City traders seem slightly more optimistic, though, sending the pound up by 0.25% to $1.30 against the US dollar, and \u20ac1.142 against the euro. European stock markets have started the new week in a subdued mood. The FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC are all basically unchanged this morning. Spain\u2019s IBEX has risen by 0.35%, but Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has dipped a little. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Further evidence that China\u2019s economy is starting to wilt under the trade war pressure \u2013 the country\u2019s latest private sector-assessing Caixin PMI dropped to a 28 month low following a services sector slump \u2013 led to a pretty muted open in Europe this Monday. Over in Shanghai, President Xi has vowed that America cannot sink China\u2019s economy. The Chinese president told a major trade fair that the days of \u201cwinner takes all\u201d trade policy is at an end - a non-too-subtle jab at Trump\u2019s approach to negotiations. Xi also pledged to keep opening up his country\u2019s economy, painting himself as a defender of globalisation. My colleague Lily Kuo reports: Xi Jinping has promised to lower import tariffs and improve access to the Chinese market in remarks meant to portray his country as a champion of globalisation as it remains locked in a trade war with the US. \u201cProtectionism and unilateralism is rising. Multilateralism and the free trade system are under threat \u2026 China will not close its door to the world and will only become more and more open\u201d, the Chinese president said on Monday at the beginning of a trade fair in Shanghai. The speech, ahead of a meeting between Xi and US president Donald Trump at the end of the month on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Argentina, signalled little improvement in trade ties before that meeting. Xi claimed China had entered a \u201cnew round of high-level opening up\u201d but did not make any concrete concessions likely to satisfy the White House. The Chinese leader reiterated a pledge to enforce intellectual property rights, as well as open up the country\u2019s educational, cultural and telecommunications sectors, something officials have been promising for years, with little action taken. Anxiety over the US-China trade war ripped though Asian stock markets again today. China\u2019s CSI 300 index fell by 0.8%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei shed 1.5%, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng has slumped by 2.3% in late trading. Traders are concerned by the slowdown in China\u2019s economy, and the lack of progress between Beijing and Washington over the trade war. Over the weekend, president Trump told reporters that the two sides are \u201cgetting much closer to doing something.\u201d A breakthrough could come at this month\u2019s G20 meeting, but nothing\u2019s guaranteed. The tumble in China\u2019s services PMI suggests that the escalating trade war with the US is taking \u201ca massive bite out of the economy\u201d, says Stephen Innes of foreign exchange firm OANDA. Here\u2019s more reaction: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears over China\u2019s economy are swirling today, as growth in the country\u2019s service sector stumbles. New figures from data provider Caixin shows that growth across China\u2019s services companies fell to a 13-month low last month, as new orders dried up. Service companies reported that new business had stagnated for the first time in almost a decade, with many saying that demand was weak this quarter. This dragged the Caixin China General Services Business Activity Index (which measures growth) down to just 50.8 in October, sharply down from 53.1 in September. That\u2019s the lowest reading since September 2017, and worryingly close to stagnation. Chinese manufacturers also had a sticky October, with costs jumping sharply thanks to the tariffs imposed on US imports. Caixin says: The slowdown was broad-based by sector, with both services and manufacturing noting weaker performances compared to the previous month. Notably, manufacturing production stagnated, following increases in each of the preceding 27 months. This dragged Caixin\u2019s wider measure of Chinese private sector growth down to a 28-month low of 50.5, from 52.1 in September. Here are the key points from the report: Services activity growth weakens to 13-month low, while manufacturing production is broadly unchanged Total new orders edge closer to stagnation Increase in service sector staff numbers largely offsets fall in manufacturing employment Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, warned that Chinese companies are losing confidence, in the face of the trade war triggered by Donald Trump. \u201cThe Caixin China Composite Output Index dipped to 50.5 in October from the previous month, reaching its lowest level since June 2016, indicating mounting downward pressure on China\u2019s economy. The subindex for new orders fell, pointing to softening overall demand conditions. The employment subindex edged up despite staying in negative territory, which could possibly be due to government efforts to stabilize the labor market. The subindex for input costs remained unchanged from the month before, while the one for output charges inched up, indicating easing pressure on company profit margins \u2014 though upward price pressure remained. The subindex for future output edged down, reflecting weakening confidence among companies.\u201d Later today we discover if Britain\u2019s service sector did any better. The UK services PMI is expected to drop to 53.3, from 53.9 in September, foll The agenda: 9am GMT: UK new car sales for October 9.30am GMT: UK service sector PMI for October 9.30am GMT: Eurozone Sentix survey of investor confidence 3pm GMT: US service sector PMI for October", "8||Something is wrong with journalism \u2013 look at Andrew Marr\u2019s Arron Banks interviewHaving watched Andrew Marr interview Arron Banks on his BBC show on Sunday, I agree with those who thought the journalist\u2019s approach was not the best way to probe him. Banks got his 30-second soundbite in first and, once again, the BBC was played. Something has gone very wrong with my profession in this country, as it has in the US. The deference to Trump that so many journalists also display to Steve Bannon and his ilk rests on an idea that has to be contested: that there is truth and there are lies and that the job of a journalist is simply to reveal the lies and \u2013 hallelujah! \u2013 everything will change. This is patently not working. Trump supporters know he lies and they don\u2019t care. They will counter this by saying the media lies about him. Remainers keep banging on to leavers that they were lied to, that a slogan on a bus was a lie. Again, they believe the reciting of this fact will change minds. But no. Of course, people who have lived in Russia have warned us about this for a long time. It is possible to exist in alternative realities, to muddy the ground between truth and lies. It is possible to think two things at the same time. It is possible to know you are being lied to and not to mind that much, as it is par for the course. To counter this, we have to hit back at the level of emotional truth; after all, this is what Facebook ads were said to be doing \u2013 appealing to people\u2019s emotional understanding of the world. The BBC, in particular, has been completely unfit for purpose and the Ukippy right wing has run circles around it. The mantra of impartiality has permitted the amplification of untruths. We need to think again.", "5||Mick Rhodes obituaryWhen Mick Rhodes, who has died aged 83, arrived in Bristol in the autumn of 1972 to take over as head of the BBC\u2019s Natural History Unit he knew that, back in London, a great deal was expected of him, and that his task was going make him unpopular with practically everyone. He was the new broom brought in from the BBC science series Horizon over the heads of the unit\u2019s own producers to rejuvenate it. The Natural History Unit had been trying to mount an ambitious global series on the life of the planet, an epic to match series such as The Ascent of Man. What had attracted attention to Mick was that one of his Horizon programmes, The Making of a Natural History Film, had won the recent best factual programme Bafta award and had then gone on to win the international Prix Italia. The Bristol staff were sceptical of Mick and his limited natural history filming experience. But David Attenborough, who was just standing down from the BBC\u2019s senior management to return to programme making, thought well of him. The two met and soon were talking about the crucial additional outside funding needed for a major series. Attenborough had contacts at Warner Bros and Mick followed them up \u2013 successfully. Over the next three years, he negotiated the funding, staffing and planning of Life on Earth, which was broadcast in 1979, as the first of the BBC\u2019s blockbuster natural history series fronted by Attenborough and seen all over the world. In 1977 Mick launched Wildlife on One, a series of half-hour films presented by Attenborough, which ran for 28 years. In that year, too, he instigated Badger Watch, the first of the series using infrared cameras developed from military technology showing how animals live in the wild, and which are now a staple of wildlife television. By the time Mick resigned in 1978, the Natural History Unit was well under way to becoming the internationally renowned production centre it is now. Mick was born in Wye, Kent. His father, Frederick Rhodes, was a professor of agriculture and his mother, Norah (nee Collier), bred dogs and was a keen gardener. After the second world war, the family settled near Cambridge. Mick went to the local Perse school, where he excelled in cross-country, rugby and sailing, the last of which became an enduring passion. After national service with the army in Germany and in Kenya during the Mau Mau uprising, he studied zoology at Bangor University. He was tempted away from PhD studies in 1964, sailing to Greenland and Baffin Island on a 60-year-old pilot cutter with the explorer Bill Tilman. Mick made a film about their journey, which he used as a passport to a job in the BBC Radio science department. One of his programmes there, Mr Blake, on the treatment of schizophrenia, won a Prix Italia and, in 1968, he was offered a job on Horizon. Over the next three years Mick produced films on everything from rheumatism to rail crashes but soon made his first natural history film, The Wood (1971), about Wytham Woods, 1,000 acres of ancient woodland owned by Oxford University and one of the most researched woodland areas in the country. This led Mick to The Making of a Natural History Film (1972), about a group of scientist-filmmakers at Oxford Scientific Films who had worked on The Wood and were now working on a film about the life of the stickleback fish. With great natural history filming and a surprisingly dramatic storyline, this modest film won not only a Bafta and a Prix Italia, but an Emmy as well. After leaving the Natural History Unit in Bristol in 1978, Mick went to the US, partly to set up a US version of Wildlife on One, and partly to be with Barbara Benedek, a New York researcher for the BBC whom he had met while she was on secondment in London, and whom he was to marry in 1986. He was also executive producer of Nova, a US series inspired by Horizon. In 1981, when I was head of BBC science television, I asked Mick to return to the BBC to run a series of half-hour popular science programmes on BBC1. It was a risky career proposition as only one series was on offer, but Mick accepted the challenge and in the event the show, QED, ran for 17 years. Its first series was a catholic mix, with films about the Turin shroud and about how to succeed with girls. It was the time of the Falklands conflict, and nuclear tensions between east and west were at a high. Mick responded to both these issues with remarkable films. He commissioned a film about a group of wounded soldiers returning from the Falklands supply ship Sir Galahad, one of whom, a Welsh Guardsman, was articulate about his own reasons for going to war. That soldier, Simon Weston, became a national hero with the broadcast of Simon\u2019s War and its sequels. Another QED, A Guide to Armageddon, was a brilliant simulation by Mick Jackson of the effect of a thermonuclear weapon dropped on central London, and prompted Alasdair Milne, BBC director general, to ask the department if it would make a fully dramatised version. At the time the BBC was being criticised for its continuing failure to show Peter Watkins\u2019s 1965 nuclear film The War Game. Milne wanted a new film to trump the original and it came in the form of Threads, Jackson\u2019s Bafta-winning drama, scripted by Barry Hines, graphically depicting life during a nuclear attack on Sheffield. Mick nursed the production through all its tricky politics. In 1984, he took over as head of BBC science features and spent five years managing Tomorrow\u2019s World, Horizon, QED and Your Life in Their Hands. His brief also included special projects such as Life Story (1987), the Bafta-winning factual drama about the discovery of DNA starring Jeff Goldblum as James Watson, Tim Pigott-Smith as Francis Crick and Juliet Stevenson as Rosalind Franklin. In 1989, he went back to producing programmes. Among numerous other projects, he thoroughly enjoyed making segments for Gardeners\u2019 World and Country File. In 1996, Mick and Barbara bought a house in France, where Mick spent his time working on the property, watching birds and gardening. For the next 12 years he divided his time between France and the UK. He was diagnosed with dementia in 2008. Mick is survived by Barbara; and by Nori, the daughter from his first marriage, to Paula Maria de Lange, which ended in divorce, and two grandsons. \u2022 Michael George Rhodes, film-maker and television executive, born 6 August 1935; died 1 September 2018", "10||Hauliers face lottery for permits in no-deal BrexitA lottery-style system could be used to allocate scarce haulage permits in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a Department for Transport paper has revealed. The paper says hauliers will need permits if no deal is struck, and the number of European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) permits available will be severely limited. One estimate suggests there will be only around 5% of the total required. The paper suggests there will be a element of chance as to which hauliers are offered the permits, to allow as many hauliers as possible to continue to operate. Permits will be allocated on the basis of criteria including emissions levels, the number of international journeys made, the proportion of haulage that is international and the product carried. But the DfT said allocating on those criteria alone would lead to an allocation solely for the biggest firms, forcing many smaller ones out of business. The department says it has thus decided that its system for allocation will also include \u201ca weighted random element to the scoring of applications\u201d, which it says will give the highest-scoring operators \u201cmany but not all of the permits they applied for\u201d. The remaining permits will be \u201callocated to a larger number of operators who have also scored highly on the other criteria,\u201d it says, which will give a fairer chance for small and medium-sized operators. \u201cWe estimate that around four times as many operators will receive permits if an element of weighted random selection is included,\u201d the paper says. The former shadow transport minister Daniel Zeichner, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: \u201cThis is yet another sector where Brexit is threatening absolute chaos. \u201cIf haulage permits become a lottery to get hold of, I don\u2019t think anyone will be thankful to have to wait longer for their new phone or to find their supermarket delivery doesn\u2019t have half the things they ordered in it because they\u2019re stuck in Calais.\u201d A leak has revealed that managers at the Environment Agency (EA) were given just 24 hours to name 75 staff to be sent to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to help prepare for a no-deal Brexit. A National Audit Office report in September said Michael Gove\u2019s department would not be ready for no-deal, with meat and dairy and chemicals exports especially threatened. Defra is responsible for almost a fifth of all the Brexit-related workstreams across government, covering the food and chemical industries, farming, fisheries and the environment. An EA memo headed \u201cURGENT Action \u2013 immediate attention\u201d, leaked to the Guardian, said: \u201cWe are gearing up our contingency planning for EU Exit and have been asked by Defra as a matter of urgency to provide staff.\u201d It was sent on 22 October, with staff asked to redeploy within a week. \u201cWe realise this is an extremely short deadline and that many staff will be on half term,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever, please do your best as part of our ambition to go the extra mile to help at this challenging time.\u201d", "6||Six teams, 11 hours, nine goals, and the ghost haunting a Saturday in Madrid\u201cThe Ghost of Butarque: that\u2019s a good name for a novel,\u201d Ernesto Valverde said. It was coming up to midnight three days after Halloween and, Barcelona\u2019s manager admitted, \u201ceverywhere we turned the Ghost of Butarque appeared.\u201d His team were back in Madrid for the first time since September, the final leg of a Grand Day Out in the capital \u2013 Legan\u00e9s v Atl\u00e9tico at 1pm, Real Madrid v Valladolid at 4.15pm, Rayo v Barcelona at 8.45pm \u2013 and it was happening again: the same feelings, the same fears. Back then, Barcelona lost at bottom-placed Legan\u00e9s, their only defeat to date; five weeks on and 15km east, they were losing to second-bottom Rayo Vallecano. Twice The Final Countdown had boomed out \u2013 the song, made all the more brilliant by not being Seven Nation Army, that celebrates every Rayo goal \u2013 and now they really were counting down. 2-1 up, Rayo were four minutes from their first home win all season; Barcelona were minutes from another defeat in Madrid, the team at the top beaten only by the bottom two. \u201cThe plot wasn\u2019t what we expected at all,\u201d Valverde said. There was, though, a twist as loosely connected threads on a Saturday in the city came together six teams, 11 hours, five posts and nine goals later. And by the time Barcelona left, they had defeated their demons, departing four points clear at the top, a gap opening for the first time in a season (although Espanyol could close to within a point on Monday night). It all started at the only place where Barcelona had been beaten. At Butarque, a sign at the gate tells Legan\u00e9s supporters to put their phones down, stand up, stop eating sunflower seeds and sing, which they did. Antoine Griezmann had scored a wonderful free kick but, Sa\u00fal admitted and Diego Simeone denied, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u201clacked ambition\u201d and Guido Carrillo got an equaliser, denying them a place at the top and sending Butarque bonkers. \u201cWe could have won,\u201d Simeone said. They could have lost too, and anyway, not winning is kind of what they do away this season: that\u2019s just one league win and five goals in six on the road. Next came the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, 24km away, where they were trying out video urinals, and where Madrid defeated Real Valladolid 2-0, amid an odd stillness punctuated by whistles. Valladolid twice hit the bar before a late shot from substitute Vinicius Junior hit Kiko Olivas and spun into the net before Sergio Ramos clipped in a penalty. That was enough to win a match that said as much about fortune as football, and politics as play \u2013 Gareth Bale, Marco Asensio and especially Ramos were whistled while an 18-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was projected as the saviour \u2013 but which Toni Kroos summed up best. \u201cWe won a league game,\u201d he tweeted, dead pan. It had taken six weeks, and they needed it, interim manager Santi Solari admitted. From the Bernab\u00e9u, the Saturday\u2019s final stop was the self-styled Independent Republic of Vallecas, 10km and a world away, the home of the last of the barrio teams. There, Barcelona took a 1-0 lead after 10 minutes, Ivan Rakitic\u2019s wonderful pass finding Jordi Alba, who pulled it back for Luis Su\u00e1rez. And that, it seemed, was that. Barcelona dominated. Only at Vallecas you\u2019re never in control \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s different,\u201d Valverde said afterwards \u2013 and25 minutes in, a roar went up from the end. \u201cTo arms!\u201d it demanded, and Rayo bore arms. Jos\u00e9 Pozo bent in a brilliant equaliser and, after Su\u00e1rez curled a wonderful shot off the post, substitute \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda scored with his first touch to put Rayo ahead. Vallecas went wild, palms hammering against metal fences. There was half an hour to go but at every turn Barcelona saw the Ghost of Butarque. Rayo were relentless. \u201cThe thing is, Rayo are very good,\u201d Valverde said afterwards, and for almost an hour they were. \u201cThey may not have won at home this season but they have had everyone on the ropes,\u201d Valverde added and they certainly had his team on the ropes. \u201cLook at them! Look at them! How they shit themselves!\u201d the fans chanted. Their version of the Marseillaise followed, and Yankee Doodle. The Final Countdown didn\u2019t, although it might have done, but that didn\u2019t seem to matter. Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 went on. Nothing. Munir went on, Arturo Vidal too. Still nothing. Barcelona pushed, and almost got caught. At the other end, there was no way through, time slipped from Barcelona, Rayo tiring but getting ever closer to the line. Alba crossed, Su\u00e1rez headed, Alberto saved. \u201cWhen you can\u2019t win one way, you try to win another,\u201d Valverde said. Gerard Piqu\u00e9 went up front and Barcelona went longer. With four minutes left, he nodded down an Alba cross and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 struck it brilliantly on the bounce and the ball flew through three sets of legs and into the far corner \u2013 2-2. Immediately, there was applause from the fans: appreciation despite the fact the victory had escaped them. And, anyway, a draw against Barcelona was still brilliant. What they didn\u2019t realise was that this was about to get worse. A throw-in, a deep cross from Sergi Roberto and there was Su\u00e1rez sliding in to score his ninth league goal of the season, his sixth in three games. On the touchline, Rayo\u2019s manager threw down his bottle. They had been so close. \u201cIt was a great game but we\u2019re hurt. We\u2019re pissed off and it\u2019s our own fault,\u201d M\u00edchel said. \u201cYou can\u2019t defend a throw-in like that in the 90th minute. You just can\u2019t, you can\u2019t.\u201d He thumped the desk, sadness in his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it. Yeah, yeah, we\u2019re proud of how we played and all that but I\u2019m pissed off,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s no good to me, it\u2019s not. We tried to beat them with our arms; you can win playing well, and we thought we had it under control. But when you have to defend, you defend, and that\u2019s it. Look, Barcelona can beat you doing what they do, but not like that. This hurts, but I want it to hurt. Let it hurt.\u201d Oh, it hurt. At the full-time whistle, Rayo\u2019s players stood, barely moving, a lost look in their eyes. The fans clapped and the players tried to clap back but there was little enthusiasm. They departed, leaving Su\u00e1rez alone on the pitch, talking to the TV, the last man off. Eventually, he walked away, Rayo shirt over his shoulder. It had been close, he knew, but the ghost of Butarque had been beaten and the significance wasn\u2019t lost on anyone. \u201cYou can lose leagues in games like this,\u201d he said. Talking points \u2022 It wasn\u2019t just Barcelona leaving it late on Saturday; it was the whole of Sunday too. A 90th minute goal from Pape Diop defeated Alav\u00e9s at Eibar; a thundering 93rd minute shot from Alfonso Pedraza saved a point for Villarreal, and maybe saved the manager\u2019s job too; and Jorge Molina\u2019s brilliant 90th minute goal got Getafe an equaliser at Huesca. Then, Sergio Canales scored a sensational free kick in the 87th minute to make it 3-3 for Betis against Celta de Vigo. \u2022 When the board went up towards the end of the Betis v Celta game with three minutes on it, there was only one reaction possible: you utter, utter bastards. The game of the season so far, wild and wonderful in the final 20 minutes or so, you wished it could have lasted forever. Betis were 2-0 up then 3-2 down, Maxi coming on for Celta and changing everything. Canales\u2019s outrageous goal gave Betis an equaliser, taking it to 3-3 with three minutes left. And even then it wasn\u2019t over, Iago Aspas thumping a brilliant free kick off the bar. Canales\u2019s wasn\u2019t even the best goal: the first, scored by Loren Mor\u00f3n, was ridiculously good, a move started with a brilliant pass from Pau and ended by an even better pass from Lo Celso, backheeled into the box. Pau, by the way, is Betis\u2019s goalkeeper. \u2022 Uruguay no m\u00e1! Su\u00e1rez, Stuani, Maxi: 23 goals between them already this season. \u2022 Identified as a kind of Captain Culpable, Sergio Ramos was whistled during Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win over Valladolid. He claimed not to really notice, but he did. When Karim Benzema won the penalty, there were chants for Vinicius to take it, even as Ramos stood over the ball, and when the defender scored he celebrated in the corner, rather pointedly, in a kind of Zen pose. There were whistles too for Gareth Bale and Marco Asensio, with hope projected upon Vinicius. This week the debate around him \u2013 should he start? why hasn\u2019t he played more? \u2013 was intense, universal, ubiquitous and exaggerated. Now, there\u2019s no stopping it. \u201cVinicius brings good luck,\u201d Marca and AS agreed, the latter pointing out that he has had a \u201cfantastic week\u201d \u2013 because he\u2019s been on their cover three times. He brings a lot more, besides. \u2022 Valencia still haven\u2019t found what they\u2019re looking for, and mostly because it was a beautiful day for Girona goalkeeper Bono who left them looking like lemons on an afternoon day in which he chose to rise up, turning all acrobat with a string of incredible saves. Valencia weren\u2019t bad but, not for the first time, they couldn\u2019t win. Eleven games, one win, two defeats and eight draws but manager Marcelino says there will be no surrender.", "0||Why Europe wants to sidestep US sanctions over Iran nuclear mightWhat was the 2015 nuclear agreement? Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in July 2015, in a deal which ended 12 years of deadlock over Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme. Struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, the agreement limited the Iranian programme \u2013 reassuring the rest of the world that it would be unable to develop nuclear weapons \u2013 in return for sanctions relief. At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran accepted strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an end to sanctions that had grown up over the preceding decade. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. All nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN body in the charge of policing the agreement, has verified 12 times since the agreement that Tehran has complied with its terms. What changed with Donald Trump? Donald Trump promised to \u201cdismantle the disastrous deal with Iran\u201d long before he was elected president in November 2016. Trump believes the agreement is a bad deal, which falls short of addressing Iran\u2019s regional behaviour or its missile programme. He is emboldened by a group of Iran hawks in his inner circle, such as the national security adviser, John Bolton, and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. Critics also say it is another example of Trump dismantling Barack Obama\u2019s legacy \u2013 the Iran deal was his signature foreign policy achievement. Initially Trump reluctantly waived a raft of sanctions against Iran. But in May, the US withdrew from the agreement and Trump announced he would impose \u201cthe highest level of economic sanctions\u201d on Iran, violating an international nuclear agreement and a UN resolution, and breaking decisively with US allies in Europe. The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council\u2019s five permanent members \u2013 China, France, Russia, the UK and the US \u2013 plus Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. Apart from the US under Trump, all other signatories have remained adamant that the agreement is working and want to keep it. What are the new sanctions? Trump\u2019s first set of sanctions were reimposed in August. Those measures hit the country\u2019s access to the dollar, gold and precious metals and the car-making sector, amid growing street protests. They were followed by a set of additional, and even more stringent measures that came into force on Monday, including an embargo on the imports of Iranian oil and sanctions on its banking sector. In October, The UN\u2019s international court of justice (ICJ) reprimanded the US over its reimposition of sanctions on Iran, ordering Washington to lift restrictive measures linked to humanitarian trade, food, medicine and civil aviation. Sanctions have returned at a critical time for Iran. A combination of factors ranging from economic grievances and lack of social and political freedoms to international pressure and sanctions has put the country under unprecedented pressure. Europe has set up a mechanism to sidestep those measures. European diplomats hope the proposed measure \u2013 known as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) \u2013 will help persuade an increasingly reluctant Iran to stay inside the deal in the hope of rescuing its economy.", "0||French town's schools are first to introduce uniformsA French town has become the first in the country to introduce uniforms for pupils in its primary schools. Six state schools in Provins, a town in the greater Paris area south-east of the capital, gave pupils \u2013 aged from six to 11 \u2013 the choice of wearing a uniform after a poll of parents organised by the local mayor. More than 60% of local parents approved the dress code in the vote in June. France\u2019s education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has said he is in favour of school uniforms as a way of \u201cencouraging pride in the school\u201d and encouraging \u201cequality between children\u201d. However, the French government has no intention of making uniforms compulsory. The 759 primary-age children in Provins, population 12,000, are being encouraged to wear clothes from a 10-piece uniform collection including navy blue polo shirts and sky blue sweaters bearing the town shield and the national motto, \u201clibert\u00e9, egalit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9\u201d. The sets cost parents \u20ac145, but the price is halved if a family has more than one child, and families unable to afford the set are eligible for subsidies. Around half the town\u2019s children made their appearance in uniform on Monday, the first day after the autumn half-term holiday. There was a mixed response from parents and pupils. No\u00e9, aged eight, admitted he was hesitant. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy because we\u2019re dressed like in Harry Potter,\u201d he told BFM TV. Another pupil told FranceInfo radio: \u201cIt\u2019s rubbish, as if we\u2019re going backwards. We\u2019re in 2018, not 1900-and-something.\u201d One Provins parent, Aktas Ayse, told French journalists she had ordered a uniform for her child but not yet picked it up. She was waiting to see how it went. \u201cEither everyone wears it or nobody wears it. Otherwise it\u2019s completely absurd,\u201d she said. School uniforms have not been obligatory in France since 1968, but have regularly risen on the political agenda. The far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen and the centre-right\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Fillon both suggested their introduction. For some, the uniform is a sign of equality and a levelling of social status and wealth; for others it is the epitome of unacceptable authoritarianism and a detraction from more serious issues such as discipline and inclusion. Olivier Lavenka, the mayor of Provins, from the centre-right Les R\u00e9publicains party, said there was no obligation to wear the uniform. He said the introduction of a dress code was an experiment that he hoped would favour \u201crepublican integration\u201d. \u201cI support the idea of freedom of choice. We\u2019ll review it term by term and see how it turns out,\u201d Lavenka said. \u201cWe want to highlight what unites us and give a good image of our education community. It\u2019s the occasion to spark a fine debate around the values of school in the republic. Lavenka said he had been approached by other local authorities keen to try out school uniforms. State schools in the French overseas territories of Martinique and Guadeloupe in the Antilles and French Guiana have expected pupils to wear uniforms since 2008. The main primary school teachers\u2019 union has criticised the move in Provins. Francette Popineau, of the SNUIPP, said uniforms \u201cmaintained the fantasy of a golden age of school that never existed\u201d.", "0||Former Belgian king ordered to take DNA test to disprove love child claimsThe private life of the Belgian monarchy has come under fresh scrutiny after King Albert II of Belgium, who abdicated in 2013, was ordered to submit to a DNA test to disprove claims that he conceived a love child during an extramarital affair in the 1960s. Albert, 84, must provide a saliva sample to the courts within three months or risk being presumed to be the father of the 50-year-old artist Delphine Bo\u00ebl, according to a ruling by the court of appeal in Brussels. A finding in favour of Bo\u00ebl would lead to the monarch\u2019s estate being split equally between her and the three children he shares with his Italian wife, Queen Paola. Lawyers for Bo\u00ebl said they welcomed the demand for a sample from the king. \u201cThe wound that King Albert struck when he cast her out has not healed,\u201d they said in a statement. Alain Berenboom, a spokesman for the king, who was on the Belgian throne for 20 years, said his client was taking legal advice on the next steps and any possible grounds of appeal. Albert has denied the paternity claim since it was first made public more than a decade ago. It has been a difficult year for the Belgian royal family. In March, Prince Laurent, King Albert\u2019s youngest son, claimed his human rights were being violated after the government decided to cut his annual grant. Laurent had been accused of diplomatic freelancing, culminating in an unapproved appearance, in full naval uniform, at a ceremony to mark the 90th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army. Among Laurent\u2019s previous forays into deeply political waters were his frequent visits to Libya between 2008 and 2010 during an attempt to go into business with one of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s sons. Albert, the son of the wartime king Leopold III, who was criticised by Winston Churchill for surrendering to the Nazis and staying in Belgium after the country\u2019s invasion, abdicated in 2013 for health reasons. On the same day, Bo\u00ebl\u2019s mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, spoke publicly for the first time about her alleged affair with the king in a television interview. \u201cI thought I could not have children because I had had an infection,\u201d she said of the relationship that it is claimed spanned from 1966 to 1984. \u201cWe had not taken any precautions.\u201d \u201cIt was a beautiful period. Delphine was a love child. Albert was not the father figure, but he was very sweet to her.\u201d Albert subsequently admitted he and his wife had gone through a marital crisis in the 1970s but the king has never admitted to fathering a love child. Bo\u00ebl has been seeking official recognition by the king for five years. Alain De Jonge, who is acting for Bo\u00ebl in the case, said of the latest judgment that the court could not force the king to give a sample. \u201cNo one in our country can be forced to do so but, if he refuses, this can turn out in Albert\u2019s disadvantage because the judge can infer from a wrongful refusal, in combination with other elements of the file, a \u2018factual suspicion of fatherhood\u2019,\u201d he said. Marc Uyttendaele, a second lawyer acting for the claimant, told the Het Nieuwsblad newspaper: \u201cThere is so much evidence that Delphine is the daughter of Albert II \u2026 We, Delphine Bo\u00ebl\u2019s lawyers, are very pleased with this decision, which is a serene and strong affirmation of the principles that state that the interests of the child should always be given priority. \u201cThis decision is an important step in the difficult battle that Delphine Bo\u00ebl has started after the failure of all amicable steps, so that her identity, and that of her children, is finally legally recognised.\u201d The current king of the Belgians, Philippe, has not commented.", "9||Sighting of sperm whales in Arctic a sign of changing ecosystem, say scientistsA rare sighting of sperm whales in the Canadian Arctic is the latest sign of a quickly changing ecosystem, say scientists, as a growing number of species expand their range into warming Arctic waters. Brandon Laforest, a marine biologist with the World Wildlife Fund, and guide Titus Allooloo were working on a project monitoring the effect of marine traffic on the region\u2019s narwhal population when they spotted the pair of large whales just outside Pond Inlet, a community at the northern tip of Baffin Island in September. Video of the incident, released at the end of October, captures the second known sighting of sperm whales in the region. In 2014, hunters from Pond Inlet spotted them in the area. At first, Allooloo and Laforest thought the dark shapes in the water were killer whales \u2013 another species that has become a frequent visitor to the waters as temperatures creep up. But the distinct shape of the dorsal fin surprised Allooloo \u2013 a veteran hunter. \u201cThey\u2019re not known by us, we don\u2019t know too much about them,\u201d Allooloo told the CBC. While a number of whales species thrive year-round in the Arctic, including beluga, bowhead and narwhal, the physiology of a sperm whale makes it difficult for them to navigate colder waters. Their heads and upper parts of the body are soft and contain an oily fat \u2013 long prized by whalers \u2013 that turns waxy in cold waters. Their bodies \u2013 which can weigh as much as 125,000lb (56,700kg) \u2013 are also ineffective at breaking through ice. While they don\u2019t represent a threat to the ecosystem, there are worries sperm whale could become trapped as winter approaches. \u201cInexperienced whales exploiting a northern habitat may not know to leave early enough before the sea ice forms,\u201d Laforest told the CBC. The vast area of the Arctic waters \u2013 estimated by Canadian researchers to measure 5.5m sq miles - makes it difficult for scientists to effectively track changes in the ecosystem, including the arrival of previously unreported species. Baseline datasets are also rare, making trend gathering difficult. Increasingly, researchers are working with Inuit communities, which have a long oral history of species in the region. In recent years, killer whales, or orcas, have also become more frequent in a number, taking advantage of longer ice-free seasons. The whales, which feast on resident narwhal, have even started changing narwhal behaviour, according to a 2017 report by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. \u201cI think the narwhal are scared to death,\u201d report co-author Steve Ferguson told the Canadian Press. \u201cWatching your brother or sister or mother get killed and eaten by a killer whale would cause a little post-traumatic stress in most of us.\u201d A recent presentation by the department also highlighted a spike in chum salmon populations the western Arctic \u2013 in numbers far greater than previously recorded. Warming temperatures have also prompted interest in the potential for expanded commercial fishing in the Arctic. In response, nine countries have agreed to ban fishing in the region until a more thorough study of the ecosystem can be completed.", "5||John Oliver denounces Trump's 'racist' family separations ahead of midtermsJohn Oliver has criticised the racist tactics of Donald Trump\u2019s White House in a new attack on the policy of family separation. On his HBO show Last Week Tonight, the comic started with discussion of the migrant caravan and Trump\u2019s unfounded statements about how dangerous and evil many of the asylum seekers are. \u201cThat is such old-timey racism. I\u2019m genuinely amazed that image didn\u2019t automatically turn black and white as he talked like Pleasantville in reverse,\u201d he said. He then proceeded to talk about the family separation policy that has seen young children ripped away from their parents at the border. It has also led to some children going missing in the system. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be able to lose children in a government system as easily as in a Chuck E Cheese ballpit,\u201d Oliver said. He played footage explaining that a policy of finding babies involved calling out their names to see who responds. \u201cAnyone who calls a baby\u2019s name and then gives up on finding them either knows nothing about babies or is covering for a baby who doesn\u2019t actually want to be reached,\u201d he said. Oliver continued: \u201cWhen it comes to \u2018How did we do this?\u2019 the answer seems to be a combination of incompetently and cruelly.\u201d In a presser with the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, she was outraged when asked if the deliberate separation was being used as a deterrent. \u201cYou can always tell you\u2019ve figured out exactly what they\u2019re doing when they get offended by your description of what they might be doing,\u201d he said. Oliver continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want immigrants to come here because they\u2019re criminals, it\u2019s that they\u2019re calling them criminals because they don\u2019t want them to come here.\u201d One of the biggest concerns is how young children are able to cope with the trauma. \u201cLasting damage to children is a huge consequence,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re separating them from their parents, not telling them you ate all their Halloween candy to get on Jimmy fucking Kimmel.\u201d Trump has repeatedly referred to the caravan as an invasion, despite the fact that it\u2019s made up of asylum seekers. \u201cEven though the language of war is being used, there is not a war, and the only reason people keep talking like there is one is to give themselves permission to make the choices they want to be forced to make but family separation cannot be one of them,\u201d he said. Oliver ended by saying: \u201cIf the president really wants to make Tuesday\u2019s election about him and about immigration then fine, let\u2019s make it about that because family separation is perhaps the most emblematic moment of his presidency so far. It was cruel, sloppy, needless, racist and ultimately exactly what we should have expected.\u201d", "11||How the Catholic schools sector outplayed the CoalitionIt was designed to be a political masterstroke. When Malcolm Turnbull announced his new funding system for public and private schools, he was flanked by businessman David Gonski, whose surname is synonymous with Julia Gillard\u2019s original reform model. The unions and the Labor party had even run a campaign \u2013 I Give A Gonski \u2013 targeting the Abbott government\u2019s decision to slash the original Gonski funding. It was working, and hurting the government. The big hope was that the optics of Gonski now standing with Turnbull would destroy Labor\u2019s Gonski campaign. But what Turnbull and his then education minister Simon Birmingham did not factor in was the sound and fury of the Catholic church \u2013 a \u201cdishonest\u201d campaign about huge fee rises, according to Christopher Pyne. Nor did they anticipate the Labor party joining forces with the Catholic church to challenge the principle of one funding model for all schools. Despite the fact that Catholic schools would secure $88bn over the next decade according to government projections, Catholics insisted they were worse off. It was war. Birmingham now concedes, for the first time, that it was a campaign that cost him his job. The price of peace, he says, was his own head on a platter. \u201cI was confident we could agree to a principled implementation ... with the nine in 10 Catholic education leaders who had always engaged with me in good faith,\u2019\u2019 Birmingham told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut if we also wanted peace with the one in 10, then a new face was clearly a prerequisite. I was happy to suggest a number of credible options, including Dan [Tehan].\u201d The \u201cone in 10\u201d, Birmingham says, is the Victorian Catholic Education Commission\u2019s Stephen Elder, a former Victorian Liberal MP. Recently, Elder expressed his \u201cregret\u201d for Birmingham\u2019s \u201chumiliation\u201d while appearing to claim responsibility for his scalp. Birmingham was a rare breed in Turnbull\u2019s cabinet \u2013 out of 18 Liberal MPs, he was one of only four who attended public schools. Tasked with the difficult job of securing Senate support for the Gonski 2.0 package, which would deliver more cash than Abbott but less than promised by Gillard, it was decided the best plan was to hang it on principle \u2013 the Senate lure was an end to special deals and one funding system for all schools, public and private. Senior Liberals now concede the one funding model agenda was crafted to appeal to the Greens, but it set the Turnbull government on a collision course with Catholics. Instead of welcoming the new cash splash \u2013 there would be billions of dollars more for public, private and Catholic schools too \u2013 the Catholic sector was furious. Bishop Peter A Comensoli, who now serves as the archbishop of Melbourne, was among the first on the phone to express his displeasure. Guardian Australia has confirmed that he rang Birmingham, accusing him of blindsiding Catholic leaders. After being duchessed by successive governments, the Gonski 2.0 announcement was a shock. But soon it became apparent that it was not simply the lack of consultation \u2013 or the threat to funding \u2013 that was the problem. It was the government\u2019s plan to publish an online estimator of schools funding and to write to parents how much their school would get that made Catholic educators furious. \u201cThere were multiple representations, including from the now archbishop of Melbourne, over that intervening period about the fact that we were going to tell every school what they were going to get, urging us not to do that,\u2019\u2019 a senior Liberal confirms. As Comensoli explained to the minister, the taxpayer-funded grants for each school went into one big \u201cpot\u201d to be redistributed. The letter from the commonwealth to parents and the actual funds schools received would not tally. (The archbishop declined requests to discuss this opposition to the transparency on how taxpayer funds were spent, citing his busy schedule at the Vatican.) Two federal byelections were used to press the Catholics\u2019 case \u2013 Batman in Victoria won by the Labor party, and Longman in Queensland. Catholic Education conducted robocalls in Batman campaigning for Labor, following party leader Bill Shorten\u2019s confirmation during the campaign that Catholic schools would secure $250m more over two years. The church also wrote to parents before the byelections to warn of possible fee rises and school closures. But many Labor observers dismiss the Catholic sector\u2019s claim of powerful interventions in the context as \u201ca beat up\u201d. They say Shorten\u2019s contact with Catholics to thank them for the robocalls was nothing more than stakeholder management. Despite this, the ALP\u2019s Victorian deputy state director, Kos Samaras, believes the idea of slashing Catholic school funding would be politically disastrous. \u201cAside from the myriad of other vote killing policies that we have embraced in the past, going down this path will wipe Labor out,\u2019\u2019 he wrote in a recent Facebook post to Labor supporters. \u201cIt would cost billions to make up the shortfall \u2026 around 200,000 odd Labor primary votes.\u201d Ultimately, the Morrison government capitulated. Scott Morrison announced a $1.2bn \u201cequity\u201d fund only for independent and Catholic schools under the peace deal, excluding disadvantaged public schools. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s going to help those Catholic schools to provide fee relief for kids from drought affected areas so they don\u2019t have to leave school,\u2019\u2019 Morrison said. But even Catholic educators scoff at the prime minister\u2019s public claim the fund is for drought relief. \u201cWhat drought relief? Over 10 years? Really?\u2019\u2019 one Catholic administrator laughs. The true purpose of the fund, according to insiders, was to deliver the cash to the Catholic sector that the parliament would not countenance. It could be done by regulation and did not require legislation. Government sources confirm it was the brainchild of independent schools. The former New South Wales education minister Adrian Piccoli, a believer who sends his children to a Catholic school, says politicians are running scared. During his tenure, Piccoli \u2013 who remains incensed that the Catholic church is resisting calls to report child sex offenders, citing the sanctity of the confessional \u2013 learned the hard way when he tried to cut funding. \u201cThey had their priests preaching from the pulpit on Sunday about how terrible the NSW government was because we were going to take a relatively small amount of money off them. \u201cAnd you know what? It really spooks MPs and I just don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t actually think that Catholics, and I am one of them, have that much faith in the Catholic hierarchy.\u2019\u2019 The Grattan Institute\u2019s Peter Goss maintains that as few as 30 Catholic primary schools faced fee increases in excess of $4,000 a year and the median family income at those schools was $200,000. He says the commonwealth has given Catholic schools \u2013 which educate about 20% of Australian children \u2013 10 times what they needed to address fee relief. But Ross Fox, the director of Catholic education for Canberra and Goulburn \u2013 hardest hit by the changes \u2013 says their complaints about the unfairness of the original needs-based funding model had been vindicated by the change to a new model using parents\u2019 tax data. \u201cWe had a responsibility to speak. At various points people used the words \u2018dishonest\u2019 and \u2018liars\u2019. Pyne certainly said \u2018dishonest\u2019. I take personal offence to that because we were never dishonest. We never lied,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cBirmingham\u2019s mistake was to think that policy purity was going to serve the interests of school children in Australia. He thought the most important thing was to get one funding model for every single school and so he put that ahead of whether schools were going to close, and fees,\u2019\u2019 Fox says. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has accused the government of pandering to \u201cbullies\u201d in the sector and having \u201csold Australian students down the river to silence a powerful lobby group\u201d. Labor\u2019s own endgame was always to outspend the Coalition, particularly on public schools. And more money for public schools is a battle the Liberals cannot win.", "19||Did you solve it? Gunpowder, reason and plotIn my puzzle column earlier today I set you the following conundrum, concerning an incident in which six men were arrested during the 1605 Gunpowder Plot. Each of the men were questioned in private about who was a traitor and who was loyal. They made the following remarks. Augustine: Felix is loyal, Erasmus is a traitor. Bartholomew: Augustine is loyal. Cuthbert: Felix is loyal, Bartholomew is a traitor. Dionisius: Cuthbert is loyal, Bartholomew is a traitor. Erasmus: Dionisius is a traitor. Felix: Augustine is loyal. It was known that loyalists tell the truth as far as they know it, so their comments about traitors can be trusted, but not their comments about loyalists. Traitors, on the other hand, know who is one of their own and who isn\u2019t, and will always give false information. How many traitors are there? Solution There are many ways to solve this puzzle, but the way I did it was to start by assuming that Augustine was loyal and see where it took me. If Augustine is loyal, Erasmus is a traitor, which means Dionisius is loyal, which means Bartholomew is a traitor, which means Augustine is a traitor. We have contradicted ourselves, so we can assume Augustine is a traitor. If Augustine is a traitor, Erasmus is loyal and Felix is a traitor. Which means Dionisius is a traitor, which means Bartholomew is loyal and Cuthbert a traitor. So there are four traitors (A, C, D, F) and two loyalists (B and E).

Less than six weeks after publishing a 1,000-page interim report that pilloried Australia\u2019s financial services industry for putting greed and the pursuit of short-term profits ahead of honesty, the commissioner has asked the bosses of the major banks to appear as witnesses in the seventh round of hearings, which begins on 19 November. Commonwealth Bank\u2019s Matt Comyn, National Australia Bank\u2019s Andrew Thorburn and Westpac\u2019s Brian Hartzer have all confirmed they will appear as witnesses, while ANZ\u2019s Shayne Elliott has said he will appear if asked. Senior executives from Macquarie Group have also been asked to appear, marking the first time an executive from the group has been asked to give evidence to the commission. Executives from AMP Limited and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank will also appear. Hayne said on Monday he wanted to explore with bank bosses some of the policy \u201cissues\u201d identified in his interim report. It blasted Australia\u2019s large financial institutions for a litany of appalling conduct, saying they had put \u201cgreed\u201d and \u201cthe pursuit of short-term profit at the expense of basic standards of honesty\u201d. It also criticised the conduct of Australia\u2019s key financial regulators \u2013 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. \u201cWhen misconduct was revealed, it either went unpunished or the consequences did not meet the seriousness of what had been done,\u201d the interim report said, pointing out that Asic \u201crarely went to court to seek public denunciation of, and punishment for, misconduct\u201d, and Apra \u201cnever went to court\u201d. Officials from both regulators have been asked to give evidence as witnesses again this month.", "11||Single parents forced to attend 'story time' or lose Centrelink paymentsRosalind Chia was so close to the finish line. The mother of two had left a violent relationship a few years ago and was now in the final year of a psychological science degree. And then the phone rang \u2013 it was Centrelink. \u201cWhat\u2019s really frustrating is if they just left me alone for another year, I was nearly finished with university,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so excited to get off Centrelink.\u201d Chia is one of 68,000 parents who have been placed on a new government program, Parents Next, after receiving a call from Centrelink assessing whether they are at risk of \u201clong-term welfare dependency\u201d. Since July, these parents \u2013 overwhelmingly single women \u2013 must meet a fortnightly participation plan negotiated with a case worker, known as their ParentsNext provider. If they don\u2019t, their parenting payment \u2013 $384.25 for a single person \u2013 can be suspended or terminated. Parents say they have been forced by their providers to attend activities such as \u201cstory time\u201d, swimming lessons or playgroup, or told to sign up to education courses at their own expense, even if they already hold qualifications. \u201cI\u2019m in financial insecurity on a fortnight-to-fortnight basis now,\u201d said Phoebe, a 37-year-old single mother of two who already holds a certificate four in accounting. \u201cIf my kids don\u2019t want to go to playgroup, what do I do? Lie? \u201cWe\u2019re not stupid. We do know how to manage our own lives. I don\u2019t think [parenting] should be devalued. I feel like there\u2019s a real sexist element to it, that you\u2019re doing nothing on the public purse.\u201d In Chia\u2019s case, a glitch with the MyGov website meant she could not mark down her university study \u2013 which she did from home. Fearing losing her payments, she took the decision to wind back to one subject this semester to focus on complying with the program by getting \u201cjob ready\u201d. \u201cThe plan was to do as much study as I can manage, as many classes as I can,\u201d she said. \u201cI was starting each semester with three. If it was too much for the little ones, I dropped to two. \u201cAt that rate, I was going to be done by spring next year. Now, it\u2019s going to take me two or three years.\u201d Welfare advocates say they are already aware of a number of mothers who have had their payments suspended under the program, including Chia. The freelance writer said when she was placed on to the program, she was not told she needed to report her income. \u201cSo the first news you get is you wake up needing to go get some food that morning and your money is not there,\u201d she said. Another woman told Guardian Australia she had her payments suspended for a week for not reporting her attendance at a \u201cstory time session\u201d at a local library. \u201cI told the ParentsNext case worker that I never agreed to that as my five-year-old has kindergarten that day,\u201d she said. \u201cShe said that my daughter had to skip kindergarten and attend the library story time sessions. \u201cI\u2019ve only been on parenting payment for a year due to separating from my youngest daughter\u2019s father and having no support. I felt being home was for the best until my youngest started school.\u201d The government announced the expansion of the $263m program in the May budget following a two-year trial, during which 3,510 participants had their payments suspended. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive that the government believes that \u2026 women aren\u2019t trying to do what they can to increase the welfare of themselves and their child,\u201d Terese Edwards, the chief executive of the National Council of Single Mothers, told Guardian Australia. Now that it was compulsory and women faced penalties for not complying, Edwards said it had gone \u201cfrom a soft touch \u2026 to almost blaming women for undertaking unpaid care\u201d. People can receive parenting payment until their youngest child turns eight, when they are moved on to the lower Newstart payment. They can be placed on to the ParentsNext program once their child is six months old. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert, who attempted to block the expansion in the Senate in September, was concerned young mothers would drop off parenting payments altogether, as she said had occurred with the community development program. Labor\u2019s employment services spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said the opposition supported the aim of ParentsNext but was \u201cfar from persuaded that the government\u2019s targeted compliance framework is suited to a pre-employment program of this type\u201d. A spokesman for the jobs minister, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, said the program had helped 3,500 participants find paid work and 9,500 participate in education or training since April 2016. \u201cParents participate in activities appropriate for their needs and family circumstances,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIf a parent is already studying or doing volunteer work, they can do this as their ParentsNext activity, while accessing other benefits of the service.\u201d Chia lamented that she had been forced to completely overhaul her career plans. \u2018\u201cIt felt like I was getting there, despite domestic violence blowing my life to pieces,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I had successfully pulled them all back together to resemble some kind of life again. And that I was going to get there really soon. But that agency has been commandeered.\u201d", "17||From music gigs to ginger tonic: refugees celebrate success against the oddsWhen Yarrie Bangura was researching how to build her grassroots ginger tonic business, she turned to an online search engine. \u201cBlack business women,\u201d she typed; \u201cbrown-skinned women doing business.\u201d Bangura, a refugee from war-torn Sierra Leone who arrived in Australia with her family 15 years ago, needed to know others had succeeded before her. \u201cI had no self-esteem,\u201d recalls the 30-something-year-old. \u201cI was fearful because I was scared that I am dreaming too big and I am stepping beyond my boundary.\u201d On the streets of Sydney, people would yell at her to \u201cgo back to your country\u201d, adding to her apprehension. But then Bangura \u2013 bright, bubbly and studying a bachelor degree in international development \u2013 teamed up with Ignite Small Business Start-ups, an initiative that helps refugees find their feet. On Saturday at the New Beginnings festival in Sydney\u2019s Darling Harbour \u2013 which showcases music, craft and food from those with refugee and migrant backgrounds \u2013 Bangura served a steady stream of customers her ice-cold Aunty\u2019s Ginger Tonic. The Australian ingredients \u2013 including ginger, tamarind and lemon \u2013 were inspired by her grandmother\u2019s garden in Sierra Leone. Ignite helped her move from a tiny business \u2013 cooking the recipe herself over a stove \u2013 to a commercial operation. The tonic is now sold online, in health food shops and cafes. \u201cI wanted to bring something from my grandmother\u2019s backyard,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to give back to the country that had given me another chance in life.\u201d With no social capital, no connections and often limited language skills, refugees typically find themselves shut out of traditional employment. Ignite \u2013 which is funded by the non-profit refugee organisation Settlement Services International, which hosted the festival \u2013 aims to help refugees bypass a system stacked against them. One 2017 SSI report, put together by Prof Jock Collins from the University of Technology Sydney business school, found that it was good for government, too. According to the report, savings on Centrelink payments added up to $880,000 a year (or $4.4m over five years) because of successful startups. At New Beginnings that success is in full swing. Food stalls including Syrian Kitchen, another Ignite business, serve up a series of delicacies from mezza to Ethiopian stew. Bands play on stage. Punters dance. And families from all walks of life gather together, sheltering in the shade. Iraqi-born Bashar Hanna, who arrived in Australia in 1998, founded the Mesopotamian Ensemble in 2016 with the goal of both bringing Middle Eastern folk to Australia and giving a platform to musicians (five out of the seven members came here as refugees). \u201cWe noticed that professional musicians coming from refugee backgrounds \u2013 there are no production companies that can open the doors for them,\u201d says Hanna, speaking backstage. \u201cIraqi people have a treasure trove of musicians and performers but not everybody knows about them yet \u2026 [This helps them] start their own career [in Australia].\u201d Performing in the Tumbalong Park, in the middle of Sydney, to an audience of all ages and nationalities \u201cwill increase their sense of belonging in Australia. Because you are accepted for a talent,\u201d he says. A Syrian singer and oud player, George Karam, known in Arabic music circles as the Assyrian King, has found in music his own path to integration. Karam fled Syria for Lebanon in 2012 with his wife and two daughters. \u201cBut there were no opportunities,\u201d he says, as his daughter, Atra Karam, a student at the University of Western Sydney, translates. \u201cAll the hard work that I [did] in Syria just vanished \u2013 there was nothing for us there.\u201d After moving the family to Australia last year (his other daughter is still waiting for her papers in Lebanon), Karam now appreciates the small things. That he can teach music, that he can play here. Speaking above the beat of drums next door, he says: \u201cAs the name of the festival New Beginnings says \u2013 that\u2019s a new beginning for me in Australia.\u201d His daughter puts it another way. \u201cI prefer it here,\u201d she says, with an infectious smile. \u201cIt\u2019s more open and safe and not closed, culturally. At least there is no war here.\u201d", "1||There seems to be no saving Floyd Mayweather from his own egoEvaluating the absurd in boxing is like trying to break open a coconut with a feather: intriguing but pointless \u2013 yet Floyd Mayweather manages to take us to that place time and again. After coming out of retirement to entertain and hugely enrich Conor McGregor (and himself) with gloves in August 2017, the 41-year-old enigma says he has agreed to swap blows of a variety yet to be determined in Japan on New Year\u2019s Eve with Tenshin Nasukawa, an acclaimed kickboxer who is 5ft 4in, 8st 6lb and 21 years younger than a hall-of-fame boxer who won world titles at five weights over 17 years. It is farcical in every way \u2013 even if they were trying to crack a coconut. Nevertheless, Nasukawa can hardly believe his luck. If they box, he will willingly take his lumps, like McGregor, to earn more money than his own sport could ever deliver; if they cobble together a hybrid contest, likewise. It will prove nothing \u2013 apart from confirming PT Barnum\u2019s infamous phrase \u201cThere\u2019s a sucker born every minute\u201d. Interested parties will try to generate discussion about the outcome, as if it somehow mattered. It will not be a lot different from an eerily similar and comic crossover fight in Japan in 1976, when Muhammad Ali, his mind and body suffering from the years he gave his sport, crossed legs (painfully) with the wrestler Antonio Inoki, another hometown hero. It has been claimed, retrospectively, that the bout was a precursor of mixed martial arts, which underpins that other profitable offshoot, UFC. Even writing this lends a form of legitimacy to the Mayweather- Nasukawa exercise but that is what much of modern sport has become: a rolling stunt. And, for purists, this is the sad part: Mayweather is one of the all-time great defensive boxers, a master of time and space, a true artist in an arcane medium. However, there seems to be no saving him from his own ego, born of boredom in semi-retirement as he dreams up his next photo-op, nor his propensity to value his worth almost purely in terms of money. Money defines him. It is the nickname he chose over \u201cPretty Boy\u201d in his early-career descent into all-out narcissism. Accumulating more money than anyone has ever managed in his sport is, for him, the gauge of greatness. He used to say he rarely needed his \u201cA-game\u201d to win a fight and often that was true. He had more gears than a Ferrari and some times he was up against no more than a pram but he always came away with the bigger purse. There will always be one comparison that matters, in boxing terms, though: that with Sugar Ray Leonard, to whom Mayweather owes much in style and attitude. And Leonard, whose self-belief was as strong as Mayweather\u2019s, still has no doubt as to who would win had it been possible for them to share a ring. Asked on Undisputed Live on US television last week (when the talk was still of Mayweather fighting either Manny Pacquiao a second time, or the unbeaten UFC fighter, Khabib Nurmagomedov), \u201cAt your greatest, were you were better than Floyd?\u201d, Leonard could give only one answer: \u201cAbsolutely. My mindset always told me I could beat Mayweather, I could beat Tyson. That\u2019s what made me who I became.\u201d Leonard\u2019s further exploration of the Mayweather mystique was more interesting than anything uttered recently in boxing. How would he beat him? \u201cThere\u2019s no one way to beat Floyd Mayweather. He\u2019s that good, he\u2019s that talented. You walk in there with a plan but to execute it takes time \u2026 see what he goes for. Nobody could penetrate his defence. He was one of the best guys out there. I would say body shots but it\u2019s so hypothetical. \u201cI don\u2019t see a weakness \u2026 I don\u2019t see him being beaten by anyone. He believes in himself so much, and that\u2019s a major part of being a world champion \u2013 like Muhammad Ali. [Floyd] talked trash but he backed it up. He may have been too defensive but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d And so we are all dragged towards another Mayweather show. Three years after his last proper fight (McGregor was a glorified spar), when he embarrassed an ageing Andre Berto, he is still able to command the attention of everyone in the fight business. He makes money. For everyone. And, for everyone, that is all that matters.", "14||Eurozone ministers line up behind EU in Italy budget disputeSeveral eurozone finance ministers have come out to back Brussels in a row with Italy\u2019s populist government over a budget that has been deemed to break the rules of the common currency bloc. France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the future of the euro was at stake as he urged the Italian government to reach an agreement with the European commission. \u201cThe wise path is the path of dialogue, exchange of views, to find the best solution for the eurozone as a whole, for the Italian government and for our common currency,\u201d he said on Monday as he arrived at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers. \u201cFor what is at stake now is our common currency.\u201d Italy doubled down on its refusal to change the budget, a week before a deadline to submit new plans to the European commission. \u201cNo little letter will make us back down. Italy will never kneel again,\u201d Italy\u2019s powerful interior minister Matteo Salvini has said. Italian deputy prime minister Luigi di Maio told the Financial Times the rest of Europe should copy Italy\u2019s expansionary public spending plans. \u201cIf the recipe works here, it will be said at a European level, we should apply the recipe of Italy to all other countries.\u201d The commission rejected Italy\u2019s draft 2019 budget last month \u2013 although other member states, including France and Germany, have broken the rules in the past without sanction. Italy must submit a new plan by 13 November and will hear Brussels\u2019 verdict on 21 November, when the commission delivers an assessment on the budgets of all eurozone members. If the commission decides to fine Italy, it risks deepening conflict with Rome ahead of European elections in May 2019, which some EU insiders fear could boost anti-EU parties. Italy believes it can reduce public debt \u2013 the second highest in the EU at 131% of Italian GDP \u2013 by more government spending to stimulate higher economic growth. The European commission, responsible for monitoring eurozone spending plans, thinks Rome\u2019s assumptions are \u201coptimistic\u201d. The commission has won support from the eurozone\u2019s traditional budget hawks, such as the Netherlands. Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, urged Italy not to pursue \u201creckless policies\u201d. He said he feared that Italy\u2019s approach would put at risk the goal to \u201ccomplete EMU architecture\u201d. Nerves about Italy are playing into slow-moving efforts to overhaul the rules underpinning economic and monetary union. French president Emmanuel Macron wants an agreement on a banking rescue system before the European elections, but has been frustrated by Germany\u2019s go-slow, less ambitious approach. Le Maire said he hoped decisions would be taken in December. \u201c[The eurozone] is the heart of the European project and it needs to be strengthened.\u201d", "14||Ryanair was 'woeful', say lawyers for racially abused passengerLawyers acting for a passenger who was racially abused on a Ryanair flight have demanded an apology and compensation from the airline, describing its response as \u201cwoeful\u201d. The lawyers said that at no time did the airline check on the wellbeing of Delsie Gayle, 77, and that Ryanair\u2019s first contact was on 2 November, 14 days after the incident, when a letter dated 21 October arrived from Ireland. A passenger seated alongside Gayle on the flight from Barcelona, David Mesher, was filmed subjecting her to racist abuse, including calling her an \u201cugly black bastard\u201d. However, crewmembers made Gayle, who suffers from arthritis and has a replacement knee, twice move seat, rather than remove Mesher from the flight. Gayle had been on holiday with her daughter Carol, a year after the death of her husband, when the incident occurred before take-off in Barcelona. In a letter to Ryanair, law firm Leigh Day says that at no point did any member of the cabin crew check her wellbeing, and met her eventual complaints with \u201cdisinterest and obstructiveness\u201d. They also say that the media were shown the \u201cprivate and confidential\u201d letter from Ryanair to Gayle long before she received it. As well as calling for an apology and compensation, the lawyers demand to know what steps Ryanair is taking, including crew training, to minimise the risk of similar future incidents. Gayle said: \u201cI felt really frightened. He should have been taken off the plane, and yet I was the one who was asked to move. Ryanair\u2019s disrespect and lack of any interest at all in my wellbeing makes me feel even worse.\u201d Richard Meeran, of Leigh Day, said: \u201cRyanair\u2019s response to the vile racist abuse Mrs Gayle was subjected to has been woeful. Ryanair needs to take this issue seriously. It should apologise properly to Mrs Gayle and compensate her for the distress it has caused her. \u201cIt should take responsibility for the crude mishandling of the incident and explain what action it has taken \u2026 and what steps it is taking to minimise the risk of future abuse of its passengers.\u201d Ryanair has yet to respond to the latest legal claims, but has previously said it only became aware of the incident via footage on social media shot by a fellow passenger, and issued an apology. \u201cWe believe that by reporting this matter immediately to the Essex police and by apologising in writing to this customer early on Sunday morning, Ryanair treated it with the urgency and seriousness it warranted.\u201d The airline contacted police on 21 October. It said cabin crew on the flight had asked Gayle if she was OK, moved her at her own request, and had not been aware of the racist abuse by Mesher.", "1||Furore over Owen Farrell\u2019s big hit leads to call for refereeing consistencyKurtley Beale said confusion will remain over tackles which merit a red card until there is consistency from referees. The Australia centre was speaking after the furore generated by Owen Farrell\u2019s challenge on Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen at the end of England\u2019s victory over South Africa. England\u2019s co-captain went into the challenge with his right shoulder and Esterhuizen came to an abrupt halt. The Australian referee, Angus Gardner, reviewed the tackle, first to determine its height \u2013 it was just below the shoulders \u2013 and then to see whether the fly-half had, as the law requires, attempted to use his arms. He gave Farrell the benefit of the doubt and did not award a penalty that could have won South Africa Saturday\u2019s Test at Twickenham. His decision divided opinion. Former players like Brian O\u2019Driscoll, Lewis Moody and Tom Shanklin supported Gardner but many on social media felt the act merited a penalty at the very least, amid confusion over how referees interpret the laws. There were also calls for Farrell to be cited but that sanction is reserved for offences deemed by a citing commissioner to be worthy of a red card and, because there had been no contact with Esterhuizen\u2019s head and Farrell had not led with his head, the threshold was not met. \u201cI just reckon that you need consistency,\u201d said Beale, who has arrived in Wales with the Australia squad to prepare for the Test against Wales on Saturday. \u201cIt is inconsistent at times: a couple of years ago it [Farrell\u2019s challenge] is a red card, or a yellow or a penalty. You just want a level of consistency through the whole thing. Clarity will come with that.\u201d Farrell has gained a reputation for going into challenges shoulder first, although in Saturday\u2019s incident he had been braced to wrap his arms around Esterhuizen, who was running across the field, but when the replacement three-quarter suddenly straightened, Farrell had to confront him head-on. When England played Australia in the 2015 World Cup Farrell was sent to the sin-bin after 70 minutes for a shoulder-first challenge on Matt Giteau. The referee, Romain Poite, said he would just award a penalty against Farrell but the TV match official, Shaun Veldsman, told him: \u201cHe\u2019s using his shoulder to tackle 12 gold without the ball.\u201d Farrell may have been sent to the sin-bin even had Giteau been in possession because no-arms tackles were being clamped down on at the time but today the focus is on reducing the height of challenges to protect the head. Which is why Danny Cipriani was sent off during Gloucester\u2019s European Champions Cup match at Munster last month. As the centre Rory Scannell ran towards him, Cipriani stood upright and, rather than attempting a tackle, allowed his opponent to run into him. As Scannell\u2019s head made contact with Cipriani\u2019s right shoulder, the law demanded he be sent off. Shanklin, the former Wales and Lions centre, believed that decision was wrong and also backed Gardner on Saturday, posting on Twitter: \u201cThere is enough of an attempt to wrap arms. Because the impact was so big and player forced backwards it\u2019s hard to grab and wrap arms fully. Borderline tackle but still believe no pen, just a MASSIVE collision. We can\u2019t take legal big hits out of the game. You\u2019re allowed to have a physical edge.\u201d Referees are meeting this week in readiness for Saturday\u2019s six Tests in Europe, with World Rugby keen to ensure consistency over high challenges. While there was general surprise Gardner did not award a penalty \u2013 which he had not when Thomas du Toit and RG Snyman tackled George Kruis shoulder first but just below head height \u2013 it supported his decision not to show a card of any colour.", "20||Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019s runaway success confirms it \u2013 2018 is the year of the critic-proof movieCritics get it wrong again! Having given the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody a broadly unfavourable review last week, I\u2019m braced for that accusation, now that the movie has been a huge hit. The film took an estimated $50m (\u00a338m) in the US at the weekend and has already made more than $140m worldwide, despite many negative reviews. It currently gets 49% on Metacritic (which aggregates critics\u2019 reviews) and a barely respectable 60% on Rotten Tomatoes (which measures the proportion of positive reviews). But, according to Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 audience score, 95% of people who saw it liked it. No critic imagines their words are going to make or break a movie, but perhaps we should question how useful we are. Poorly reviewed movies are becoming box office hits with increasing regularity. Take the Spider-Man spin-off Venom: \u201cClumsy, monolithic and fantastically boring,\u201d according to the Guardian\u2019s film critic, Peter Bradshaw. On Metacritic, Venom gets 35%, Rotten Tomatoes: 29%. But again, Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 audience score is 87% and it has made more than $500m. Our weapons are useless against them and we know it. If you had asked me if Bohemian Rhapsody was going to be a hit, I would have said: \u201cYes, definitely.\u201d One thing many critic-proof hits have in common is brand recognition. You know what you\u2019re getting \u2013 triply so with Bohemian Rhapsody: an iconic star (Freddie Mercury), a medley of familiar Queen songs and a straight-ahead rock-biopic format. Barely any movies find success without being a sequel, a franchise instalment or a reboot. It used to be the star power of actors that drew in audiences and defied critics; now it is the star power of the people they\u2019re playing. Critics do sometimes get it \u201cright\u201d \u2013 hits such as A Star Is Born, Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War were all positively reviewed \u2013 but there\u2019s so little correlation, we might as well be picking names out of a hat. This is where the movie industry begins to look archaic. If we don\u2019t like a TV programme, we can watch a different one at no extra cost. We can listen to music before we decide to buy it. Most retail items are refundable. But with movies, you\u2019re still paying a lot of money upfront for an experience you may not enjoy. If people actually listened to critics, they would go to even fewer movies and the industry might collapse altogether. And then we would be out of a job. So, er, don\u2019t listen to us.", "1||'Our lives depend on it': NFL players urge fans to vote in midterm electionsMembers of the Players\u2019 Coalition, the group of NFL stars formed during the protest movement started by Colin Kaepernick, have urged Americans to vote in this week\u2019s midterm election saying \u201cour lives depend on it\u201d. The letter was published on Monday on the Players\u2019 Tribune and signed by Washington\u2019s Josh Norman, the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 Chris Long, the New York Jets\u2019 Kelvin Beachum and former Chicago Bears running back Matt Forte. Although the players do not endorse any candidates or parties in the article, they are critical of policies and tactics favored by Donald Trump and the Republicans. \u201cRight now, our collective national identity is one of pain and despair, of confusion and anger. We are fractured, we are hurting and too many are finding themselves as mourners. But America\u2019s true identity is one of greatness,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cWe may have deep scars, but from times of darkness we have emerged as a nation with the courage to protect our neighbor from harm and the willingness to insist on our shared values of hope, of inclusion, of community. We have always stood up for each other. We have always been able to reclaim our identity. \u201cOn November 6, we can return to that place. We can raise our voice and remind our officials and each other that we are more than the hate we have seen. With our vote, we can say that we believe in and are committed to the happiness, the health and the lives of all Americans. We can tell the world that we are a country worthy of our reputation as the world\u2019s greatest nation. This is what is at stake with your vote.\u201d The midterm elections will effect the composition of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and are seen by many as a referendum on the presidency of Trump. \u201cThe magnitude of our decisions this November is huge,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThe senators that we elect will pick the justices who preside over federal courts for decades, giving them an enormous influence over how our Constitution and Bill of Rights will be interpreted. The representatives we put into Congress will decide what the future of health care looks like for us and for our children, what taxes are paid and by whom, and whether the natural environment of our planet is protected. And these future members of the United States government will decide whether to preach messages of hope and unity, or messages of hate and division.\u201d The players also touch on controversial issues in the run-up to the election, such as gerrymandering and the suppression of minority voters. \u201cIf you think your vote doesn\u2019t matter, just look at how hard certain officials are trying to suppress it,\u201d the players write. \u201cIn Georgia, one lawsuit alleges that 53,000 newly registered voters have been placed in \u2018pending\u2019 status because of a law that disproportionately affects minority voters, while another claims that 340,000 voter registrations were incorrectly canceled by Brian Kemp, the secretary of state who is currently running for governor. In Michigan, North Carolina and Texas legislators have drawn voting boundaries to cram as many like-minded \u2013 often minority \u2013 voters into one district.\u201d The Players\u2019 Coalition negotiated a deal with the NFL that saw the league agree to donate $89m towards social justice projects. However, not all NFL players were happy with the settlement, with some seeing it as a sweetener to stop the protest movement started by Kaepernick, who is still without a team. Last month, the Carolina Panthers\u2019 Eric Reid, a close friend of Kaepernick, confronted a prominent member of the coalition, Philadelphia\u2019s Malcolm Jenkins, before the start of their teams\u2019 game. Reid called Jenkins \u201ca neo-colonialist sellout\u201d.", "0||German spy chief loses out on government role after firebrand speechGermany\u2019s outgoing domestic intelligence chief has been denied a promised post in the interior ministry after he delivered a firebrand speech repeating claims video footage showing far-right protesters chasing down migrants in Chemnitz this summer was fake. Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen had been promised a post as a special adviser in the interior ministry after he was removed as head of the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) in September. Instead, he will be retired from all offices with immediate effect, the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said in a statement on Monday afternoon. The reason for the decision, said Seehofer, was \u201cunacceptable\u201d comments Maa\u00dfen made during a farewell speech in Warsaw in mid-October to fellow European intelligence chiefs that were then posted on the BfV intranet. In the speech, the text of which was published in the German press on Monday, Maa\u00dfen repeated and expanded on his earlier claim that media had \u201cmade up\u201d reports of far-right gangs \u201chunting\u201d foreigners during unrest in the eastern German city of Chemnitz in August. \u201cThese \u2018hunts\u2019 never happened, according to the findings of the local police, state prosecutor, local press, the state premier and my colleagues,\u201d Maa\u00dfen told his European peers in Warsaw on 18 October. \u201cThey were made up.\u201d He continued: \u201cI\u2019ve experienced a lot of German media manipulation and Russian disinformation. But that politicians and media make up \u2018hunts,\u2019 or at least spread this false information without checking it, was for me a new quality of false reporting in Germany.\u201d Maa\u00dfen\u2019s initial claim that the videos were fake cost him his job as intelligence chief in a spat that nearly brought down Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government in September. In an interview with the Bild newspaper, Maa\u00dfen directly contradicted Merkel\u2019s spokesman, who had used the word Hetzjagd, or \u201chunt\u201d, to describe attacks on migrants in Chemnitz. His comments followed weeks of far-right unrest in the eastern city in August in which multiple witnesses reported and filmed crowds chanting xenophobic slogans, gang aggression and illegal Nazi salutes, sparking outrage far beyond German borders. Maa\u00dfen\u2019s attempt to downplay the incidents had fuelled suspicion of far-right sympathies within the German establishment. Maa\u00dfen\u2019s predecessor, Heinz Fromm, stepped down after reports went missing into the neo-Nazi terrorist cell, the National Socialist Underground, that murdered 10 people, mostly immigrants. Earlier this year, a whistleblower former member of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) wrote in her book that Maa\u00dfen helped the former party leader Frauke Petry with advice, a claim he disputes. At the time Maa\u00dfen first claimed the video was fake, the coalition partners were split over the issue. Seehofer, who heads the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU), had backed the intelligence chief, while the Social Democrats (SPD) wanted him gone. In a face-saving compromise, Seehofer offered Maa\u00dfen a job in the interior ministry. In his farewell speech in October, Maa\u00dfen told colleagues he had been chased out of office by \u201cleftist radical elements in the SPD\u201d who wanted to bring down the coalition government. He went on to describe himself as a known critic of \u201can idealistic, naive and left-wing policy towards foreigners and security\u201d.", "21||Tate Britain to hold major Van Gogh exhibition in 2019Tate Britain is to hold its first Vincent van Gogh exhibition since a 1947 show that was so wildly popular that the gallery\u2019s floors were damaged. \u201cI think our floors are more robust these days,\u201d said Alex Farquharson, Tate Britain\u2019s director, as details were announced of the major 2019 show, which will explore Van Gogh\u2019s relationship with Britain and his impact on British painters in new ways. Last time, people queued in the cold and rain to see a five-week long exhibition organised by the Arts Council of Great Britain. Over 157,000 people came to the show, including the Queen. Newspapers compared the scenes with the queues outside food stores during rationing \u2013 \u201cAnd now they queue to see paintings\u201d \u2013 putting the exhibition\u2019s success down to people being \u201ccolour-starved\u201d by the austerity of postwar Britain. Tate has discovered in its archive a letter to the Arts Council requesting reimbursement for three years\u2019 worth of damage to its floors over the five weeks. A reply has not been found. Many of the visitors had never visited an art gallery before and they came even though it cost a shilling to get in on weekdays. That raised \u00a33,000, one newspaper reported. Around half the total visitors came at weekends, when it was free. Tate said it was bringing more than 45 Van Gogh works to the new exhibition, the largest group of works by the artist to be seen in the UK for nearly a decade. The exhibition will tell the story of the young Vincent, an economic migrant who lived in London between 1873-76 as a trainee art dealer. He lodged in Brixton and fell in love with the city, walking everywhere. Important loans will include Self-Portrait 1889 from the National Gallery of Art in Washington; Starry Night over the Rh\u00f4ne 1888 from the Musee d\u2019Orsay in Paris; and Prisoners Exercising 1890 from the Pushkin in Moscow. Closer to home will be the loan by the National Gallery of one of its superstars, Sunflowers 1888, one of only four paintings by Van Gogh of the subject which still exist. It will be a homecoming of sorts: Sunflowers hung at the Tate for four decades before a change in its remit saw the painting sent to the National Gallery in 1961. Curator Carol Jacobi said people had always \u201cunderstood its importance, its magic\u201d. It was first shown in London in 1910, lent from the personal collection of the artist\u2019s sister-in-law Johanna van Gogh-Bonger who wanted British viewers to see Van Gogh\u2019s very best work. It returned in 1923, shown at Tate alongside The Bedroom and The Yellow House. All three were determinedly not for sale despite Tate\u2019s entreaties. Van Gogh-Bonger\u2019s resolve eventually softened. In a letter to be featured in the show, she wrote: \u201cI know that no picture would represent Vincent in your famous gallery in a more worthy manner than the \u2018Sunflowers\u2019 and that he \u2026 would have liked it to be there \u2026 It is a sacrifice for the sake of Vincent\u2019s glory.\u201d Sunflowers will be shown at Tate Britain alongside British artwork inspired by it, including paintings by artists including Christopher Wood, Jacob Epstein and Frank Brangwyn. \u2022 Van Gogh and Britain at Tate Britain, 27 March-11 August 2019.", "10||Female politicians from around world mark century of UK women\u2019s suffrageA young Bosnian MP who denounced her uncle\u2019s war crimes, a member of the Syrian opposition and a Gambian women\u2019s rights campaigner are among the female parliamentarians who will sit in the House of Commons chamber this week. A landmark event on Thursday will celebrate the centenary of women\u2019s suffrage in the UK, involving more than 100 female politicians from around the world, from Afghanistan to the Vatican. Among those will be a young Bosnia and Herzegovina MP, Lana Prli\u0107, who came to national prominence for supporting her uncle\u2019s sentence for war crimes against Bosnian Muslims. Prli\u0107, who was elected last month and serves as vice-president of the country\u2019s Social Democratic party, has campaigned against nationalism and ethnic segregation, which she experienced growing up in Mostar. After her uncle Jadranko Prli\u0107\u2019s indictment, she issued a press statement calling for the court\u2019s decision to be respected and upheld, prompting anger from some nationalists. Prli\u0107 said the conference was a chance for her as a new female MP to share examples of good practice. \u201cI was raised by a single mom, and through my life I saw [from] that example how women can be strong, doing at the same time visible and invisible jobs for the society, for the community, for family,\u201d Prli\u0107 said. \u201cWhen one woman stands up for herself, she stands up for all women, and we as MPs must stand for all women, for all of us.\u201d Another attendee is Ya Kumba Jaiteh, a leader of the Gambia\u2019s female lawyers\u2019 association, who also chairs the country\u2019s trade committee. Jaiteh will bring her infant daughter to the conference, the Department for International Development said. The Gambian MP said she was pushing for 50% female representation in both parliament and the cabinet. \u201cMen will never empower women willingly but \u2018unpower them\u2019 in the name of tradition and religion,\u201d she said. \u201cThe conference will provide me the opportunity to learn from MPs from countries with high representation of women in parliament, [about] how this was achieved.\u201d Others slated to attend include the first female speaker of the Bangladeshi parliament, Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, and Bassma Kodmani, a prominent member of the Syrian opposition. The international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, who will make a speech to open the event on Thursday, said the women gathering from around the world had the same ambition: \u201cto make women\u2019s empowerment a global priority\u201d. She said many of the women who would attend the event had made history in their countries by increasing female representation. \u201cNow it\u2019s up to us to advocate for vulnerable women around the world and give them a voice to fight for their rights and overcome violence, discrimination and repression,\u201d she said. \u201cUnless every woman can thrive and reach her full potential our nations and humanity will not reach its.\u201d It will be co-hosted by Labour\u2019s former deputy leader Harriet Harman, who as the longest-serving female MP is \u201cmother of the house\u201d. Ministers attending include Mordaunt; the leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom; the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott; and the shadow equalities minister, Dawn Butler. Working groups will look at different issues facing women parliamentarians around the world, including bullying, harassment and empowering women once they become MPs. Downing Street has not yet confirmed whether the prime minister will attend. Later, the women will have an afternoon policy session looking at women\u2019s economic empowerment, ending violence against women and girls, family planning and breaking the barriers to girls\u2019 education. The event was almost scuppered after the Conservative MP Christopher Chope shouted \u201cobject\u201d when the motion to host the gathering was put to the Commons this year, but it was later passed after an intervention by Mordaunt. Chope had previously been the subject of a separate row after he objected to another private member\u2019s bill to make \u201cupskirting\u201d a specific criminal offence.", "1||Thunder Snow \u2018happy\u2019 despite Christophe Soumillon\u2019s whip techniqueThunder Snow was said to be unharmed by his experience of running third in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic, in which the severe use of the whip by Christophe Soumillon shocked sections of the audience in Britain. Saeed bin Suroor, the trainer, said on Monday: \u201cI checked the horse after the race, he looked good, he looked in good form, fresh and happy, like he never had a race, no problem at all.\u201d Soumillon was not punished by the Churchill Downs stewards after Saturday\u2019s race but the whip rules in Britain suggest he would have been banned for three to four weeks had he made similar use of it here. The rider, a highly successful veteran who generally keeps within the whip rules in Britain and France, appeared to use it 16 times on Thunder Snow and did so at times in a rapid-fire style almost never seen on British tracks these days. British stewards examine any ride in which a jockey uses a whip more than seven times in a Flat race; using it 16 times would normally lead to a 19-day ban. Additional days can be added if a rider uses the whip with excessive force, without allowing the mount time to respond or without regard to the horse\u2019s stride, the penalties starting at two days in each case. That suggests a total ban of around 25 days for a ride like the one Soumillon gave Thunder Snow. There would also be a fine, likely to be significantly higher than the \u00a36,550 levy imposed on Richard Johnson after getting a seven-day ban in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Soumillon\u2019s whip use was described on Twitter as \u201cabsolutely brutal\u201d by the trainer and former jockey Brendan Powell, while the former British champion jockey Richard Hughes also criticised the Belgian during an appearance on Racing UK. Bin Suroor declined to criticise his jockey. \u201cChristophe tried to get the best result in the race. He\u2019s a world champion jockey. I have a lot of respect for him. It\u2019s a big meeting, all the jockeys are trying to get a good result.\u201d", "0||Death of family in Italian floods shines a light on illegal buildsThe villa in the Sicilian town of Casteldaccia where a family of nine died during floods last Saturday could have been demolished two years ago. The property was built too close to the Milicia River, in an area of high hydrological risk, but the owners appealed against a demolition order and it was never carried out. The nine members of the Giordano family who died, including three children aged one, three and 15, appear to be the latest victims of illegal Italian construction that has led to thousands of deaths. Men, women and children have lost their lives trapped in houses built without proper authorisation, thrown together in areas of high seismic risk, a few steps from rivers or at the foot of hills at hydrogeological risk. According to data from the Italian Territorial Agency, 1.2m homes in Italy are illegal. The Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) said that in 2015 alone nearly 20 illegal buildings were put up for every 100 authorised ones. \u201cWe have built and continue to build in areas where we shouldn\u2019t ever have,\u201d Maurizio Carta, a professor of city planning at the University of Palermo, told the Guardian. \u201cWe have erected villas and buildings in fragile areas, along riverbeds, in areas prone to landslides, along cliffs, and in high-risk hydrogeological and seismic areas, which increases the risk for people living there \u2013 in essence, where they should not be living in the first place.\u201d According to magistrates, a building in Torre Annunziata, in the province of Naples, that collapsed on the night of 7 July 2017, killing eight people, was illegal. Many houses that collapsed in Ischia during an earthquake in August 2017 had been built without proper authorisation. Prosecutors have launched an investigation into the deaths in Casteldaccia. Magistrates who visited the villa on Sunday morning said they suspected the property was built illegally. According to the newspaper La Stampa, in 2012 Italian prosecutors ordered the demolition of 46,700 buildings but only 10% of that plan was executed. Corriere della Sera,citing official data from Istat, the non-profit environmental association Lagambiente and Cresme, the Italian Institute for Economic Research, said 80% of the demolition orders issued from 2004 to 2018 had not yet been executed. In 2016 Angelo Cambiano, the then mayor of Licata, in the province of Agrigento, tried to enforce the law and presented a demolition plan for dozens of houses in the city that had been built without regular authorisation. As a result, he said, \u201cthey burnt down two of my houses, I received three letters containing death threats and an envelope with bullets.\u201d Cambiano said he had to have a police escort for more than a year. Cambiano was not intimidated and carried out his demolition plan. Then his own city council decided to get rid of him. Seven of the councillors who demanded and supported a vote of no confidence against the mayor were owners of houses that had to be demolished. \u201cI was kicked out for trying to enforce the law,\u201d said Cambiano, who returned to teaching mathematics. \u201cBut unfortunately today the policy is of consensus and people obviously do not like demolitions. There are regional deputies in Sicily who have been elected because in the election campaign they promised to put a stop to my demolition orders.\u201d Instead of ordering the demolition of houses, Italian politicians have often adopted regulations that save engineers and owners from convictions, enriching the state at the same time \u2013 a process called condono edilizio, which translates as \u201camnesty building\u201d. The process is that the owners of an illegal building have the opportunity to save their home from demolition by paying a sum of \u20ac60-\u20ac150 (\u00a353-\u00a3131) per square metre of their house. In return, the state abandons criminal prosecution. From 1985 to 2004, Italian governments decreed three nationwide building amnesties (the last one during the government of Silvio Berlusconi), collecting a total of about \u20ac16bn. \u201cWe should have thought about building in safe areas; we should have carried out demolitions to guarantee first of all the safety of the inhabitants,\u201d said Piero Pelizzaro, the chief resilience officer for the city of Milan. \u201cInstead, for many years the state has traded our own safety for money. We saved our homes from demolitions but we could not save our children\u2019s lives.\u201d", "16||Can frantic dreams tire you out?If you have highly active or scary or exciting dreams, do they actually make sleep less restful and restorative?

The Iranian economy has been under strain since May, when Donald Trump exited the 2015 nuclear agreement \u2013 designed to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear programme \u2013 and announced the return of sanctions. His first set of sanctions were reimposed in August. Those measures hit the country\u2019s access to dollars, gold, precious metals and the car-making sector, amid growing street protests. And on Monday Trump unilaterally reimposed further sanctions, despite opposition from the US\u2019s European partners of the nuclear accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The new sanctions were timed to coincide with the anniversary of the 1979 US hostage crisis. \u201cFor ordinary people, sanctions mean unemployment, sanctions mean becoming poor, sanctions mean the scarcity of medicine, the rising price of dollar,\u201d said Akbar Shamsodini, an Iranian businessman in the oil and gas sector who lost his job six months ago as European companies started to pull out of Iran in fear of US sanctions. \u201cBy imposing these sanctions, they want to force Iranians to rise up in revolt against their government but in practice, they will only make them flee their country,\u201d he said, adding that ironically it would be Europe that would have to bear the burden of such a mass migration. \u201cWe\u2019re being squashed here \u2026 as an Iranian youth who studied here, worked here, the only thing I\u2019m thinking about now is how to flee my country and go to Europe.\u201d Mahdi Attar, a postgrad student of mechatronics in University of Tehran, said most Iranians feared the impact of sanctions on the price of the dollar, which has more than tripled. One dollar buys roughly 145,000 rials this week, compared with 40,500 a year ago. He said Iranian students now had to deal with much pricier payments for exams such as TOEFL or GRE, buying books online or simply paying for application fees when applying for universities abroad. \u201cPlease inform Mr Trump that he has been cruel to us, the people of Iran; ask him not to pretend he\u2019s on our side. Let the mask fall,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s sanctions, however, have been welcomed by the US allies in the region. The Israeli minister for education, Naftali Bennett, a politician from a righwing religious party, thanked Trump on Twitter for \u201cmaking the ayatollahs scared again\u201d. Vahid Hatami, 27, who works in the banking software sector, said he earns around \u00a3100 ($130) a month \u2013 a salary that supports his parents and younger brother. \u201cIn the past six months as the situation is getting tough, if I didn\u2019t have a job it means that my family would have been in trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are despairing. You look at people\u2019s faces in the metro and the mood is gloomy. Iranian people like their country, they don\u2019t even have any way to protest against this situation. There\u2019s no way to vent your anger.\u201d Iraj Kaveh, who has a company in Tehran specialised in importing wear-resistant steel plate from Belgium, said he could easily trade until March, but it is now finding it almost impossible, or with commissions of up to 11%, because of banking restrictions. \u201cWe used to use both public and private banks or money exchanges to pay Belgium\u2019s KBC bank, but since June all our money transfers gets rejected, citing US sanctions,\u201d Kaveh told the Guardian. \u201cThese plates are used in our mining and cement industry and if companies use the domestic equivalent, it means they have to change them every two months, while the European version last for more than a year.\u201d Rouhani said the US was using the language of \u201cpressure and threats\u201d against the people of Iran. He said Washington was isolated in its anti-Iran stance, except for a few allies, in what appeared to be apparent references to Saudi Arabia and Israel. He said: \u201cThe US is proud of backing a regime that kills the people of Palestine every day, putting them under bombing. They are proud of supporting a regime that is killing the people of Yemen every day.\u201d", "15||Energy cost of 'mining' bitcoin more than twice that of copper or goldThe amount of energy required to \u201cmine\u201d one dollar\u2019s worth of bitcoin is more than twice that required to mine the same value of copper, gold or platinum, according to a new paper, suggesting that the virtual work that underpins bitcoin, ethereum and similar projects is more similar to real mining than anyone intended. One dollar\u2019s worth of bitcoin takes about 17 megajoules of energy to mine, according to researchers from the Oak Ridge Institute in Cincinnati, Ohio, compared with four, five and seven megajoules for copper, gold and platinum. Other cryptocurrencies also fair poorly in comparison, the researchers write in the journal Nature Sustainability, ascribing a cost-per-dollar of 7MJ for ethereum and 14MJ for the privacy focused cryptocurrency monero. But all the cryptocurrencies examined come off well compared with aluminium, which takes an astonishing 122MJ to mine one dollar\u2019s worth of ore. \u201cMining\u201d is the name for the process by which blockchains, such as those that underpin cryptocurrencies, are regulated and verified. In bitcoin\u2019s case, for instance, the currency is backed by \u201cminers\u201d due to the absence of a centralised authority confirming transactions. These miners effectively enter a competition to waste the most electricity possible by doing pointless arithmetic quintillions of times a second. One lucky competitor wins both a reward, worth about eighty thousand dollars in bitcoin, and the right to verify all transactions made in the last 10 minutes. The rewards may be virtual, but the energy cost is very real. Previous attempts to gauge how much electricity is burned to power the bitcoin network, still the largest blockchain in existence, have focused on looking at the size of the network in aggregate. In November 2017, one estimate placed the power consumption of the network as equivalent to that of the nation of Ireland. Another noted it was producing the same annual carbon emissions as one million transatlantic flights. The new paper is the first to look at the mining efforts from the point of view of energy cost per dollar benefit. \u201cThe comparison is made to quantify and contextualise the decentralised energy demand that the mining of these cryptocurrencies requires,\u201d the authors write, \u201cand to encourage debate on whether these energy demands are both sustainable and appropriate given the product that results from relatively similar energy consumption (when normalised by market price).\u201d To account for the wild fluctuations in cryptocurrency price, and therefore effort expended by miners, the researchers used a median of all the values between 1 January 2016 and 30 June 2018, and attempted to account for the geographic dispersal of bitcoin miners. \u201cAny cryptocurrency mined in China would generate four times the amount of CO2 compared to the amount generated in Canada,\u201d they write, highlighting the importance of such country-dependent accounting. In the long term, the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies will vary not only with their market value, but also according to the adoption of new technologies. The Ethereum project, for instance, has expressed an interest in moving from the energy intensive \u201cproof of work\u201d to a relatively untested alternative, \u201cproof of stake\u201d.", "16||Do animals have a sixth sense that detects the current in railway tracks?Although the borders of railway lines are teeming with wildlife, you rarely see dead animals lying beside the electrified third rail.

The only team in the top \u2013 Fiver gets bored after counting \u2013 seven tiers of English football yet to win, Huddersfield sit bottom of the pile due in no small part to a chronic inability to score, but will surely never have a better chance to secure victory than when they host a team suffering from an equally chronic inability to defend. Fulham, for their part, sit second bottom of the same pile due in no small part to a chronic inability to defend, but will surely never have a better chance to keep a clean sheet than when they visit a team suffering an equally etc, and so on. Something\u2019s got to give at the John Smith\u2019s Stadium tonight and having witnessed the truly shambolic performances put in by both sides in defeat in their last league excursions, The Fiver\u2019s banking on it being at least one, if not both rearguards that get the Monday Night Football pundits squawking in horror. David Wagner was already established as a folk hero in Huddersfield for the heroic feat of getting them to the Premier League in the first place. Keeping them there as they punched well above their weight last season cemented his status, but he is finding the task considerably trickier this season. The sight of the German praising his players for their performances following one defeat after another has become a recurring theme, a state of affairs that hasn\u2019t been helped by the fact that they score goals at a rate that make even Southampton and Crystal Palace seem prolific. No fewer than 17 different Premier League players have scored more than the Terriers this season, which suggests they need some much-needed bite to match their bark. \u201cFor us it is important to make sure we are on our best and that we show exactly the performances which we have shown in the last home games and in the away games against Burnley, for example,\u201d said Wagner. \u201cIf we are at our best then we have a chance to be successful, but first we need to be at our best.\u201d If playing well against fourth-from-bottom Burnley is the high new benchmark of success, Fulham will fancy their chances. The Cottagers may have shipped 15 goals in their past four defeats, but did spank four past Sean Dyche\u2019s team in winning their first three points of the season. Already rumoured to be under pressure despite reassuring clucking noises from his chairman, Slavisa Jokanovic could do with a repeat performance. \u201cIt is a frustrating situation for myself, my players and our supporters, but we cannot give up and there is a long way in front of us,\u201d he said ... this time last year when his team were 16th in the division below and critics were ridiculing their prospects of winning promotion. He turned things round then and will fancy his chances of doing so again, on a Bonfire Night that could boast no end of fireworks or the mother of all damp squibs.

Unexpectedly, her latest track isn\u2019t a paean to staying in with Netflix and pizza, and dancing around to Robyn, but a celebration of masturbation. \u201cMaking love to myself / Back on my beat,\u201d she sings, post-breakup. Anyone with a cursory knowledge of popular music will know that this is a pretty popular subject. The example that immediately springs to mind is one-time Missy Elliott prodigy Tweet\u2019s Oops (Oh My), released in 2002. Tweet was never seen again, which is perhaps just as well given that her name became the No 1 medium for slinging insults. Cyndi Lauper referred to her solo sessions as a She-Bop. Then there\u2019s Britney\u2019s Touch of My Hand and Divinyls\u2019 unsubtly titled I Touch Myself. But it\u2019s not all about the women: the Buzzcocks\u2019 Orgasm Addict is excellent, even though it contains the very grim line: \u201cNow your mother wants to know what all those stains on your jeans.\u201d Dude. The title of Elvis Costello\u2019s Pump It Up seems self-explanatory on reflection, but it took me a while to realise it wasn\u2019t about turning up the volume. Prince, not known for being backwards in coming forward, once wrote a song, Darling Nikki, in which he \u201cmet her in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine\u201d. Many questions to be asked, here. First among them: why was Nikki not arrested? Violent Femmes denied that their early 80s hit Blister in the Sun was about masturbation, which I am happy to go along with (because it sounds painful). Even Tweet at one point years later said Oops (Oh My) was about \u201cbody-positivity\u201d. Which maybe I could believe, if she hadn\u2019t also announced that she has taken a vow of celibacy. Making love to herself, back on her beat, then. What\u2019s the reasoning behind this popular, pleasurable topic? For artists, I suppose it negates the risk of writing a conventional love song, breaking up with its subject and having to sing it for years afterwards. For the listener? Well, relatable songs are the best, aren\u2019t they?", "8||Time to stop being coy about sex \u2013 and give young people the truthI had just turned 11 when Salt-N-Pepa released a track that made my ears burn on first hearing: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about sex baby. Let\u2019s talk about you and me. Let\u2019s talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be. Let\u2019s talk about SEX.\u201d It was quickly recorded on to a cassette and listened to surreptitiously. God forbid my parents should hear and think I wanted to talk about sex with them. But of course, as a preteen and then teenager, it was a conversation I did want to have. One I hoped would make me feel normal amid the swirl of overwhelming hormones. My parents were, for their part, ordinary in their attitude towards \u201cthe talk\u201d. They could be best described as squeamish, preferring to be vague on details but with a huge dollop of fear because \u2026 PREGNANCY. They were, and are, not alone. Ineptitude sits close to denial; both act as effective weapons for those who\u2019d rather shirk a tricky responsibility. On this matter our schools have proved no different. Deemed best placed to curate discussions around sex, they have done so with an incompetence that has left young people unable to talk about the good and bad of s-e-x. Britney Spears was dressed in a school uniform demanding \u201cHit me baby one more time\u201d when the current sex education curriculum was first published. That year Monica Lewinsky was pilloried by public opinion that was too sexist to recognise that the 22-year-old intern might be a victim in the grim spectacle. Our schools largely ignored these teachable moments and were silent on such milestones. No wonder then that it is a curriculum feminists have long criticised for inadequately meeting the needs of today\u2019s young. Where is talk about consent, sexting and the explosion of online pornography? Nowhere. Why is there such a reluctance to arm young people with the information and discussions they need to go on to have healthier sexual relationships? Thankfully in the government\u2019s new relationships and sex education (RSE) draft curriculum there is now explicit mention of these issues, and on Wednesday the Department for Education (DfE) closes its consultation on it. Yet there is still a danger it could fail many of our young by repeating old mistakes \u2013 and by ignoring the issues young people want to talk about. It\u2019s clear from the draft curriculum that violence against women and LGBT experiences are still issues seemingly difficult to broach \u2013 best handled with the language of ambiguity or outright silence. There is talk about coercion, but no room to place that in the context of gender inequality. There is, too, a repeated return to the centrality of marriage, admittedly with an acknowledgment that this includes same-sex marriage. Yet this jars with making the teaching of LGBT relationships discretionary. It is why the feminist organisation Level Up is calling for people, especially the young, to have their say and respond to the government\u2019s draft consultation. The aim is to let the government know that LGBT experiences should be an integral part of sex education rather than a tacked-on optional extra. To ignore this would be to let down the thousands of LGBT young people grappling with their sexual identity, who are already made to feel out of place. A survey by the government itself found that for 31% of young people, it is a priority that they are taught about gender and sexual identity. We all have stories of that one sex ed class where a teacher, usually barely able to contain their own discomfort, instructs a class of giggling teenagers on how best to place a condom on a cucumber. It tells us much that the memory of sex education for so many is one of awkward tittering \u2013 and a very clear sense that sex is something to be feared if not avoided. But even in that scenario, most could at least say they found their sexual identity reflected in the content of discussion. The same could not be said for LGBT students whose teachers were legally bound under section 28 to desist from teaching \u201cthe acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship\u201d. Fifteen years on from the repeal of the act, and despite proposed changes to the curriculum, RSE in many schools might be more accurately described as heterosexual sex ed. If schools can decide to opt out of teaching LGBT experiences, the government must accept that those relationships will not be normalised and LGBT young people will be made vulnerable as a result. That LGBT students would be given sex ed without seeing themselves reflected is a repudiation of their sexual identity. It is the type of silence that can easily breed self-doubt and loathing, not to mention bullying and coercion. This new curriculum is supposed to be a step forward. Instead it feels like we are stuck in the past. \u2022 Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and Level Up board member", "12||More than a million readers contribute financially to the GuardianMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the Guardian in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to Guardian News and Media\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to \u201cregain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society\u201d. Viner told the Society of Editors\u2019 annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the Guardian to stay free and outside a paywall, so \u201cprogressive journalism can have the widest possible impact\u201d. \u201cMany readers didn\u2019t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the Guardian,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was helped by the fact that any money made by the Guardian has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner. \u201cThis entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the Guardian to break even by next April. And we\u2019re absolutely on track to do that.\u201d She also announced that Guardian News and Media, as part of its commitment to a diverse workforce, would carry out an audit of employee pay by ethnicity during the next 12 months, in order to ensure the organisation treats individuals fairly. Viner used her speech to highlight the Guardian\u2019s commitment to investigative reporting on topics such as the Windrush scandal and Cambridge Analytica, while calling for news organisations to collaborate more and commit to in-depth reporting. \u201cToo many important stories get \u2018drive-by\u2019 coverage, when what they deserve after the big moment is patient attention, forensic reporting which reveals injustice, or gives a voice to the silenced. News organisations must never de-prioritise the vital skill of finding things out, getting to the facts, and reporting them clearly,\u201d she said. At the same time, she said, the Guardian had a responsibility to use its journalistic platform to develop ideas and not just critique what was going wrong in the world. \u201cThe Guardian will always embrace progressive policies and ideas, but in an age of filter bubbles and hyper-partisan politics, we must also make space for different ideas, and diverse opinions,\u201d she said. \u201cOur guiding focus will be to challenge the economic assumptions of the past three decades, which have extended market values such as competition and self-interest far beyond their natural sphere and seized the public realm.\u201d Guardian News and Media is aiming to break even this financial year after many years of losses and Viner said initiatives such as the relaunch of Guardian Weekly as a glossy magazine were exceeding expectations, with its biggest group of new subscribers millennials. Viner also used her speech to pay tribute to her predecessor Alan Rusbridger as a fantastic editor who understood and embraced the digital revolution. The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night. \u201cHis record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,\u201d Viner said.", "8||Piles of burning wood and raw sausages? Let\u2019s make bonfire night a national holidayIn many ways, Britain lags behind the rest of the world when it comes to nation-specific holidays. We don\u2019t have days to commemorate the passing of a beloved leader, for example, and we certainly don\u2019t have an independence day \u2013 possibly because we\u2019re usually the country that everywhere else wanted independence from. Similarly there\u2019s no Thanksgiving here, because what on earth do we have to be thankful for? Twixes? Superdrug? It hardly seems worth it. Everywhere else does it so much better. Ukraine has a holiday to mark the Russian military intervention of 2014. Japan has different holidays for its mountains, oceans and shrubbery. Bhutan has a day off just so everyone can go out in the rain. But us? Just Christmas, Easter and a handful of badly defined days in the middle. It\u2019s a legitimately dismal state of affairs. So let\u2019s make a pact: next year, let\u2019s make bonfire night a national holiday. It makes so much sense. What\u2019s more British than bonfire night? Nothing, that\u2019s what. It\u2019s a glorious \u2013 and gloriously British \u2013 celebration of everything this country holds dear. It\u2019s a chance for us to wrap up warm, huddle together, eat disappointing food and watch something ostensibly fun that\u2019s never quite as good as it\u2019s supposed to be. In short, it\u2019s the most British thing ever. Forget St George\u2019s Day or any of those ugly Brexit Day proposals. Bonfire night should become a formally observed celebration. We should all take the day off work for it. Admittedly, it has problems that probably need to be addressed. It\u2019s historically an aggressively Protestant celebration \u2013 the Observance of 5 November Act 1605, enforced with mandatory attendance of a church service for 250 years, required the reading of a text about \u201cmalignant and devilish Papists, Jesuits, and Seminary Priests\u201d \u2013 and, to this day, it inspires behaviour that we could probably do without. Burning effigies of public hate figures is always a bit iffy, and the less said about the blacked-up children of Lewes the better. But we can fix this. We can officially separate Guy Fawkes night and bonfire night. Guy Fawkes night is too knotty and political for everyone to get behind. But bonfire night? A night devoted to the twin spectacles of communal fire and magma-temperature baked potatoes? Who could possibly argue with that? And while we\u2019re here, let\u2019s get rid of the fireworks. The rest of the world has fireworks, and even here we\u2019ve begun to smear our displays across the calendar so indiscriminately that 5 November fireworks aren\u2019t even that special. Besides \u2013 and this is a truth that only the bravest among us will admit \u2013 fireworks are rubbish. They\u2019re stupid and boring and only spectacular to people whose short-term memory loss is extensive enough that they forget they\u2019re essentially just watching the same thing over and over again for 20 minutes. In the entire history of the world, there has only been one decent firework display; the Oban community firework display of 2011, where someone pressed the wrong button and set all the fireworks off at once, and even that was 30 seconds too long. Apart from that, fireworks are terrible and only idiots like them. Sorry, I don\u2019t make the rules. So where does that leave bonfire night? It leaves it as a toothless holiday stripped of visual interest and historical context. It leaves it as a holiday where people just pile up a load of wood and set it alight while eating half-raw sausages off a stick. And, sure, that might not sound like very much to you, but it\u2019d be a day off work, OK? Are you too good for a day off? You make me sick. \u2022 Stuart Heritage is a feature writer for the Guardian", "22||LSO/Noseda/Bostridge review \u2013 musical forces fire up James MacMillan war premiereHowever moved you are by Charles Hamilton Sorley\u2019s poetry, you can\u2019t visit his grave; his body was lost in the mud of Loos, in France, in 1915. He was 20, only just older than the most senior members of the National Youth Brass Band of Great Britain, which lent extra poignancy to the performance of these 80-odd teenagers in All the Hills and Vales Along, James MacMillan\u2019s new oratorio. It\u2019s a London Symphony Orchestra and 14-18 NOW commission and a more intimate version of the five-movement work, a first world war memorial, was given last month at MacMillan\u2019s Ayrshire festival the Cumnock Tryst. This, though, was the premiere of his grand-scale version, with the massed strings of the LSO conducted by Gianandrea Noseda. MacMillan has written a practical, performable piece, and all to the good: not every choral society can muster Britten\u2019s War Requiem. The strings support the tenor \u2013 here, as in Cumnock, Ian Bostridge, resonant and urgent, although on this occasion stretched at the extremes of pitch. Full brass power is saved for moments of greatest effect. The choral lines, put across with conviction by the London Symphony Chorus, are singable, the style easily digestible, the words set so as to be audible, even over the band \u2013 whose playing was first rate. But the restlessness of the tenor line in the final movement, set against a choral melody that flirts with both Bach\u2019s Air on the G string and Elgar\u2019s Nimrod, threatens to distract from the extraordinary text. Perhaps Sorley was not in Wilfred Owen\u2019s league, but how many 20-year-olds in 1915 could have written such a mature verse as To Germany, blending realism and idealism in a vision of a future peace? Few composers have had to be so aware of the gulf between the real and ideal worlds as Shostakovich, whose Symphony No 4 made for a heavy counterweight. Noseda drove the first movement hard, setting a pace for the string fugue that would undo a lesser orchestra, but the second was almost stubbornly measured. Notwithstanding one or two episodes of real character, and some outstanding extended solos, there was ultimately a sense of the work\u2019s peaks and troughs being flattened into routine brilliance. \u2022 On BBC Radio 3 on 9 November.", "2||'A new cultural era': midterms see firsts as candidates poised to make historyOn Tuesday, Americans could elect as many as three black governors, including two in southern states that once were part of the Confederacy. Arizona voters will send a woman to the Senate for the first time, regardless of who wins the razor-thin race there. Colorado could elect the nation\u2019s first openly gay male governor. Women are running in record numbers. Native Americans, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants, millennials and LGBT candidates are poised to make history \u2013 some two or even threes times over. \u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of not only a new political era but a new cultural era powered largely by the women of color who are on the ballot on Tuesday,\u201d said Aimee Allison, president of Democracy in Color, a organization that backs voters of color. Many of the new crop of candidates are motivated by alarm at the election of Donald Trump and propelled by a wave of liberal activism. Victories could deliver a forceful rebuke to a president who has stoked racial and cultural division. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams, who in May became the first African American woman to win a major party nomination for governor, is locked in fiercely contested battle with Republican Brian Kemp. Ilhan Omar, a former Somali refugee and the Democratic nominee for a congressional district in Minnesota, is likely to join Rashida Tlaib, a Democratic nominee in Michigan running unopposed, as the first Muslim women in Congress. Deb Haaland, the Democratic nominee in New Mexico, is favored to win her House race and become the first Native American woman in Congress. A number of Republicans could also make history. Tennessee and Mississippi could elect women to the Senate for the first time. John James, the underdog in the Michigan Senate race, would be the first black person to represent the state in the upper chamber. Kristi Noem would be South Dakota\u2019s first female governor. The diversity points to a dramatic shift in the political landscape. According to an analysis by the New York Times, the share of House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates who are white and male is at its lowest point in four elections. US politics is changing at time when Trump and some Republicans are exploiting deep culture divisions as a campaign tactic. The result is an election that Trump has framed with some of the most charged issues in US politics: race, gender and identity. Such tensions have reached fever pitch during the Florida governor\u2019s race. In a debate, Ron DeSantis, a Republican running on a Trumpian platform, was asked about his decision to speak at events hosted by a conservative who has made racially inflammatory comments. DeSantis was defiant, saying he would not \u201cbow down to the altar of political correctness\u201d. His Democratic opponent, Andrew Gillum, who would be the first black governor of the state, replied: \u201cI\u2019m not calling Mr DeSantis a racist. I\u2019m simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\u201d The intensity of this election has been underscored by events. A Florida man was charged with sending explosive devices to more than a dozen high-profile critics of Trump and CNN. A day later, a Pennsylvania man was charged with a federal hate crimes over the massacre of 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Trump has threatened to end birthright citizenship and to roll back protections for transgender people. On Twitter and at campaign rallies, he has stoked fears about a group of Central American migrants approaching the US border on foot, describing it as an \u201cinvasion\u201d. Last month, the confirmation of supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was confirmed after accusations of sexual assault, which he denied, roiled both supporters of both parties. \u2018Women like me aren\u2019t supposed to run\u2019 Issues of identity and race have also played distinguishing roles, particularly in Democratic primaries where there was less of an ideological gulf between the candidates. \u201cWomen like me aren\u2019t supposed to run for office,\u201d Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a campaign video that launched what was at the time considered a long-shot bid for Congress. In June, the young Latina political newcomer beat the fourth-ranking House Democrat in the primary for her Queens- and Bronx-based district. At 29, she will likely be the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. In Massachusetts, Ayanna Pressley, a 44-year-old black Boston councillor who ousted a 10-term incumbent in the Democratic primary, stressed the importance of identity. \u201cI fundamentally believe that the people closest to the pain should be closest to the power,\u201d she said on the campaign trail, amplifying her slogan: \u201cChange can\u2019t wait.\u201d Jehmu Greene, a progressive political analyst on Fox News, said: \u201cWhat is refreshing with many of these candidates is their fearlessness. We\u2019re seeing them own their expertise and their experience \u2026 they are refusing to play by a set of rules designed by white male political consultants and they\u2019re winning.\u201d One key factor behind the surge in diverse candidates is demographic change. As the US becomes more diverse, so does its slate of candidates for office. At the same time, organizations have cropped up, dedicated to recruiting and training for office women, young people and religious and ethnic minorities. For Democrats and first-time office-seekers especially, surveys indicate that Trump has provided the major motivation to run. In many races, such candidates are running explicitly as a check on his presidency. Experts say Trump, who never held office before winning the White House, also helped lower the barrier to entry for candidates who may have feared they were under-qualified. For all the signs of change, however, women and minorities are still significantly underrepresented on Capitol Hill. The election of 1992, the original Year of the Woman after the Clarence Thomas supreme court nomination battle, nearly doubled the number of women in Congress \u2013 to a less than whopping 10% of the total. It took the next quarter-century to double that. This cycle, women \u2013 51% of the nation \u2013 make up just 32% of all Senate candidates and 29% of all House candidates, according to the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP). There are significant disparities by party: 43% of Democratic candidates for Senate and House are women while women make up 22% of Republican Senate candidates and 13% of its House candidates. Women will remain woefully underrepresented. If women win all of the House contests they are favored to win and competitive races considered a \u201ctoss up\u201d, they will still only hold about 24% of House seats, according to CAWP. Heather Barmore, director of communications for VoteRunLead, a nonpartisan organization that trains women to run for office, said political victories for women and minorities in 2018 would set the stage for 2028 and 2038. \u201cYoung girls who are watching them now will think: \u2018Hey, she looks like me. If she\u2019s running for office with her natural hair or her hijab than I can run too,\u2019\u201d Barmore said. \u201cThis is not just a momentary trend. We are moving into a period we can expect to see more and more candidates running who are representative of the electorate.\u201d", "1||Boxing plays Russian roulette with choice of Rakhimov as presidentAnyone who has ever stepped into a boxing ring knows it is generally not a good idea to drop both hands below your waist, stick your chin out, and dare a much bigger opponent to knock you out cold with their best shot. Yet that is what Aiba, amateur boxing\u2019s governing body, appears to be doing after an extraordinary presidential election in Moscow. Aiba knew the International Olympic Committee had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the governance and direction of the sport. And that it really did not want Gafur Rakhimov, a man accused by the US treasury of being one of \u201cUzbekistan\u2019s leading criminals\u201d \u2013 something he strenuously denies \u2013 to be made president. So what happened? Rakhimov was elected on Saturday after defeating his sole rival, Serik Konakbayev, by 86 votes to 48. But only after the electronic system had refused to work and Aiba was force to construct a makeshift voting booth made with tables stacked together and covered with sheets. To make matters worse, ballot papers needed to be put into a cardboard box with the logo of the French gardening company Leroy Merlin on it. As one onlooker put it to me, all that was missing was the Benny Hill theme tune playing on loop. Now the dust has settled, two things are clear. Rakhimov rules Aiba and the IOC has to quickly decide whether to bite the bullet \u2013 or fire it by suspending Aiba from international sport. Its decision, which is likely to come this month when the IOC meets in Tokyo, could have huge ramifications for boxing. For now, however, neither side is backing down. To his supporters, Rakhimov won fair and square, despite what they see as the naked IOC threats. They also insist the Uzbek is rescuing the sport after it was close to bankruptcy after the Azerbaijani company Benkons had demanded immediate repayment of a $10m loan last year \u2013 and say the issues of the previous regime, under the former president CK Wu, should not be held against it. Wu denies any wrongdoing. But it is not so simple. Much of Aiba\u2019s executive committee under Wu is still in place after the latest elections \u2013 including the vice presidents \u2013 and the IOC may legitimately wonder why a body that did not adequately scrutinise Wu will ensure good governance this time, or implement the reforms it is demanding. Incidentally one new ExCo member is the Chinese businessman Di Wu, which comes as something of a surprise given I reported last year he served documents on Aiba demanding it pay back an 18.99m Swiss francs (\u00a313.6m) investment which his company First Contract International Trade put into Aiba\u2019s marketing arm, BMA. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Wu also accused Aiba of \u201cmismanagement\u201d and \u201cgreatly infringing on my rights\u201d. Yet little more than a year on, Wu is on Aiba\u2019s executive committee \u2013 and the organisation has 18.99 million reasons to be grateful he has withdrawn his claim. Some argue this is a brilliant piece of realpolitik from Rakhimov but not everyone agrees. Critics say that for Aiba to convince the IOC it has changed it must show it is being run by the best of the best lawyers, accountants and business brains \u2013 not just on patronage and understandings. Others note with concern that Russia, which is paying \u00a33m to host next year\u2019s world championships \u2013 double the previous highest hosting fee \u2013 has a far greater influence, too. At what price? Incidentally, there has been a lot of misleading talk about boxing been banned from Tokyo 2020. That is not going to happen. This is about the fight for the soul of the sport \u2013 not the sport itself \u2013 and the prospect of a new governing body. Depending on who you speak to, this would either be an organisational nightmare or entirely feasible but the IOC, which hands Aiba \u00a313m after each Olympics, does not intend to come out of this looking weak. As one observer put it: \u201cAiba seem to have this delusion this is a debate with the IOC but the IOC largely bankroll you. The IOC picks who it wants to work with. And if you want to take its money, you play by its rules.\u201d Of course Aiba is far from alone when it comes to issues with sports governance. In the past week the International Weightlifting Federation has allowed four lifters from Turkmenistan to compete in their home world championships even though they did not fill in their \u201cwhereabouts\u201d status . And there have been ongoing issues at Fifa as well as rows over the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s conduct over Russia. Yet all too often this stuff swims above people\u2019s heads. For much of the public the words \u201csports politics\u201d operate not so much a call to action as an immediate snooze button. As a result it is too easy for sports bodies to chug along without scrutiny or institutional checks. As recently as 2015, for instance, the respected Play the Game organisation found no federation published reports on remuneration, including per diem payments and bonuses, of its board members and senior officials. How can this be? How can people not care? These eyes, however, will remain on Aiba and the IOC as it continues its game of chicken. The fascinating question is, who will blink first?", "3||\u2018If you don\u2019t see them, they get tipped in\u2019: rise in rough sleepers using bins for shelterAs winter draws closer, waste containers \u2013 especially those containing cardboard \u2013 become increasingly important for rough sleepers. Binmen Jamal and Steve know this well. Every weekday, before they work their central London route, they are reminded by their depot foreman that as well as paper, plastic and aluminium, the containers they pick up may contain people. Finding people sheltering inside waste containers is relatively rare \u2013 millions of bins are emptied every year in the UK with nobody inside \u2013 but rising homelessness has meant it is an increasingly common situation, with the result that Jamal and Steve must look carefully before they tip waste into their lorry\u2019s compressor, known as \u201cthe vulture\u201d. \u201cYou can\u2019t spot people if they\u2019re sleeping under cardboard when you open the bin,\u201d says Jamal, as he waits for the morning rush hour traffic to move. \u201cIf you don\u2019t see them, they\u2019ll get tipped in the back. It could kill them.\u201d \u201cA grisly death,\u201d adds Steve, who is driving the lorry. \u201cI found people sleeping inside bins in an old job,\u201d Jamal continues. \u201cYou think: what should I do? Wake them up?\u201d This week, it was announced that 3,103 people slept rough in London between July and September 2018, a record for the capital, according to the Combined Homelessness and Information Network database operated by homeless charity St Mungo\u2019s. Government figures for rough sleeping in England, which are collated using a different methodology, have risen 169% since 2010, with 4,751 bedding down overnight in 2017. Waste disposal companies have experienced the impact of this rise. Last winter, Veolia recorded 32 reports of people found inside their bins in the UK, up from 26 the year before. Biffa, which often operates larger commercial containers, discovered 175 people in its bins in 2016, and is set to launch its second major awareness campaign in two years about the issue in January. These figures rely on internal reporting and the true extent of the issue is unclear, but its consequences can be fatal. In 2014, the remains of a man were found by staff at a waste recycling plant in Bristol. Matthew Symonds, 34, had been sleeping in a waste bin under cardboard in Swindon after he was refused entry to a homeless shelter and was tipped into a bin lorry as he slept. A coroner was not able to establish exactly how he died, but noted his body suffered \u201csignificant disruption\u201d. Rough sleepers are not the only people that die in this way. Some revellers climb into bins at the end of a night out, with fatal consequences. At least 11 people died between 2010 and 2016, according to previous reporting. The Health and Safety Executive told the Guardian it had investigated three deaths resulting from people sleeping or sheltering in bins in the last two financial years for this article. Later this month, an inquest into the death of a homeless man who suffered crushing injuries to his legs after he was tipped into the back of a lorry as he slept in Rochester, Kent, in January will begin. A pre-inquest review heard that Russell Lane died during surgery weeks later from complications related to his injuries. The number of deaths means that checking bins for people has become a regular part of the health and safety routine for waste disposal companies. \u201cFrom time to time, it is known that persons take refuge inside waste containers, particularly containers of 660ltr and larger,\u201d reads the dry warning in a briefing at the depot where Jamal and Steve arrive at 5.30am every day. \u201cChecking containers for persons prior to engaging on the lifting mechanism is quick, simple and straightforward and could save someone\u2019s life,\u201d it continues. Staff are told to watch out for rucksacks, sleeping bags and food near the bin, which might indicate someone is inside. If they find someone, they\u2019re told to report it immediately. Despite the health and safety fears, waste containers remain a key part of survival on the street. In the maze of underpasses underneath the roundabout by Waterloo station, long-term rough sleeper Jimmy, a 51-year-old Glaswegian, was sheltering from the torrential rain outside surrounded by his possessions. \u201cCardboard keeps you off the concrete. It\u2019s the best thing there is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d tapping the blankets around him, which are supported by a thick stack of cardboard. \u201cIt\u2019s so important. Rain is our worst enemy. If you get wet then that\u2019s it.\u201d The army veteran, who started sleeping rough after his partner died during a miscarriage and he started experiencing mental health problems, said there are often better places to sleep rough than bins in London, but they can provide a break from the dangers of sleeping outside. \u201cI had a friend who nearly got tipped in. We\u2019d been drinking and it started to rain, so he jumped in for a nap. When the binmen came, he nearly got put in the back. He jumped out just in time,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to sleep in a bin shed in Kennington when I was travelling,\u201d he added, continuing to talk about the dangers of the street. Jimmy recalled waking up one night to a man preparing to urinate on him. Others have tried to destroy his possessions. On their round, Steve and Jamal are aware of these issues and are careful not to throw the possessions of people who might be rough sleeping into the back of their lorry. The pair spend a large part of their morning removing food and dog poo from the recycling bins, but often leave cardboard on the side of a street where they know rough sleepers need it. Steve points at the stacks of cardboard. \u201cIt shows you the reality of what\u2019s going on, that someone has to do that,\u201d he says.", "23||Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week: Sometimes good books can be found in unusual places, as tommydog shows: I was up in the mountains fishing and on the cabin\u2019s bookshelf was We Pointed Them North: Recollections of a Cow Puncher by EOC Abbott, aka Teddy Blue Abbott. It turned out to be a fun read and rather interesting. A friend, Helena Smith, basically wrote the book from Teddy\u2019s dictation, poor grammar and all. He wanted to set the record straight in the late 1930s that while life on the post Civil War frontier was hard, it was also a lot of fun\u2026 It was a fun book, ideally suited to nights in a mountain cabin. In some of it you can see the source of countless western themes. Other aspects of life on the 19th century ranches are surprising (roller skating for example). Astonishing. Just in case you were wondering, here\u2019s a definition of \u201ccowpuncher\u201d. (It isn\u2019t someone who goes around thumping cows.) On the subject of frontiers, Dennis89 has been \u201cthoroughly enjoying\u201d The Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard: A monumental account of Scott\u2019s tragic 1912 expedition to the South Pole. Since starting this book I feel that my concentration at work has waned... My thoughts keep ferrying me off to the wonder, beauty and isolation of Antarctica. I walk home from work eager to get back into that world of crevasses, comradeship, endeavour and altruism. Yes, there are the formidable details of the journeys undertaken and the conditions experienced but the real joy lies within the description of the human relationships that are formed in such a hostile and unforgiving environment. But humans aren\u2019t always so noble. William Golding\u2019s Lord Of The Flies has brought back memories for quickspace: Just read Lord of the Flies for the first time, finishing it yesterday with the horror of boyhood re-emerging 41 years later, the panic and cruelty boys inflict on each other. Having gone to an all boys school after flunking my 11+, the hierarchy and mob mentality felt familiar, though I don\u2019t think anyone was brutally murdered by a mob or had their brains bashed out by a fuck-off rock. Oddly, the description of Simon\u2019s corpse reminded me the description of Curly\u2019s wife after her death in Of Mice ... At least in tone, curiously poetic and so sad I bawled my eyes out, which I\u2019m glad happened now and not in my school days. The Portable Dorothy Parker, \u201ca collection of her short stories, poems, reviews and personal correspondence\u201d has impressed JohnHunt: Everything in the book is short, though the book itself runs to just over 600 pages \u2026 Like Runyon, Parker is very much of time and place and, again like Runyon, the time runs from the 1920s to the early 1950s and the place is New York and its environs. Parker knows her characters and she\u2019s betting that you have a passing familiarity with them as well. Her stories are told from an unapologetically female perspective, often a woman\u2019s internal dialogue. If you appreciate a good zinger at the end, if you need someone who\u2019s quotes you will be able to recall at just the right moments, if you are looking for a good laugh or a way to consider the female perspective from her time period, Parker is your sure guide. Parker also wrote A Star Is Born if you\u2019re wondering if she is still relevant today. You just can\u2019t go wrong. Anna Burns\u2019 Milkman has worked for chasm: I\u2019m surprised by the reviews that described it as a difficult read, I thought it pretty accessible. I also thought it the best Booker winner for some years, original, thought-provoking, humane, and unputdownable. Meanwhile, jinxsboy51 recommends The Butchering Art: Joseph Lister\u2019s Quest to Transform the Grisly World of Victorian Medicine by Lindsey Fitzharris: Very readable history of the transformation that occurred in medicine; about the role of infection and sterilisation in making a big difference in surgery survival rates. NOT for the those with queasy stomachs. Finally, talking of stomachs, annegeraldine has been focussing on Thackeray\u2019s Vanity Fair: The men have gone off to battle in Waterloo leaving Amelia a pitiful wreck and Becky planning her strategy should she be widowed. Joseph Sedley remains with the women: \u201cAt half-past two, an event occurred of daily importance to Mr Joseph -- the dinner-hour arrived.

Happy reading!", "10||Labour London assembly members face reselection fightLabour London assembly members are likely to face full mandatory reselection, which could lead to several prominent party moderates being deselected, a leaked email has revealed. It is understood that the Labour assembly group leader, Len Duvall, has expressed serious concerns about the proposals, which would overhaul the candidate selection ahead of the next mayoral race The Guardian has seen an email in which London-wide assembly members (AMs) were told they could potentially face full, open selection by party members. The decision has not yet been agreed by Labour\u2019s governing national executive committee. There are 14 constituencies across London that each elect one AM by the first-past-the-post system. The remaining nine, of which Labour hold three, are elected from a closed list with proportional representation \u2013 meaning that the higher up the party\u2019s list a candidate is placed, the better the chance of being elected. The email sent last week from the party\u2019s acting London regional director, Andy Smith, said the organisation committee had decided those London-wide members would face \u201can open selection with members voting to rank where on the list nominees would appear\u201d. Sources told the Guardian the change was likely to cause concern for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. The three London-wide Labour AMs are all party moderates. They are Sadiq Khan\u2019s deputy mayor for fire, Fiona Twycross; the Labour group\u2019s lead housing spokesman, Tom Copley; and Nicky Gavron, a former deputy mayor under Ken Livingstone. As incumbent AMs, the trio will automatically be on the ballot \u201cbut would not be automatically ranked in the highest position on the final list\u201d, the email says. The new system would likely mean the three lose their positions at the top of the list, should any influential leftwing group such as Momentum decide not to back them. Any new nominees will be based on nominations from constituency Labour parties and regional affiliates, Smith\u2019s email says. List members have historically been selected by the regional board \u2013 a system that has caused past concern for being undemocratic. However, Duvall is understood to have told the party he is extremely worried that experienced AMs would be given the boot as part of a factional divide. Smith\u2019s email also says that the constituency AMs, who make up the bulk of the party group, will be subject to a trigger process, broadly in line with that faced by MPs.\u201d Party members at Labour conference in September voted to back new rules that MPs must face full re-selection if requested by more than one-third of local branches or more than one-third of the local affiliates, such as trade unions. Momentum has argued that all MPs should face an open selection process at each election, saying Labour\u2019s present system stifles alternative candidates. The group, which controls all of the nine seats for party members on the NEC, is understood not to have been directly involved in pushing for the change, but is likely to be supportive. \u201cThe current system is a straight stitch-up where Labour members have no say in who runs as a Labour candidate. Open selections [are] obviously the most fair and democratic way to choose candidates, and the current system is completely out of step with the mood of the membership.\u201d The NEC must sign-off the new rules before they come into effect. A Labour source said serving AMs still stood a good chance of keeping their seats even if the changes were accepted. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that you end up with very different outcomes to last time, but it\u2019s only really one small change in the process,\u201d the source said. \u201cAround 92% of 2017 general election candidates that re-stood in early selections were reselected. AM selections will be much the same.\u201d", "8||The living wage is a powerful weapon against poverty. More must pay itPoverty is not merely living life on a small budget. It is a daily scramble, corroding those caught in its traps. It decays hope, self-respect and stability. It cripples all those it encounters, forcing its victims to spend each day trapped in the fear and humiliation associated with low pay. This reality faced by many working families living on minimum wage is a blight on society. In my Durham diocese alone, there are 44 food distribution centres \u2013 a number of which also run debt centres. The city food bank has a fuel voucher distribution service for families forced to choose between heating their homes and feeding their families: it\u2019s run by a remarkable team of volunteers. In one of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations this should not be necessary; yet it is. Rather than waiting until our friends and fellow citizens fall into poverty, we should be transforming not just our welfare system, but also our workplaces. By ensuring wages are set to reflect a real cost of living and that working hours are the right length and reliable, people need not live a life of constant struggle. Almost 60% of people in poverty are in families where at least one person is in work. As rents rise and bus and train fares increase, it\u2019s often the poorest who are hit the hardest. The real living wage \u2013 a voluntary pay rate adopted by more than 4,700 employers \u2013 rises today to \u00a39 an hour in the UK and \u00a310.55 in London. This is a way in which every employer, from a small church to a big FTSE company, can play its part in ending the injustice of poverty. During the past week, I have heard powerful stories from two women whose lives have been transformed by their employers. Alison, a Heathrow airport worker, described her life as one riddled with anxiety about growing debt until her employer announced that they would be raising her pay to the real cost of living. Lynne, meanwhile, was in a minimum-wage cleaning job with shifts as long as 15 hours a day. When she moved to FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, a longstanding supporter of a real living wage, she was able to reduce her hours to manageable levels and spend more time with her family. When employers treat their employees with dignity and respect, they also help to realise the potential of their staff, and the benefits for all are clear to see: one piece of research from the Living Wage Foundation found that worker absenteeism fell by 25% after employers gave the real living wage. Employees are not raw materials to be bought at the cheapest price. Treat others as you would wish to be treated yourselves \u2013 and it will pay dividends. There is also a need for the government to do more. While the higher minimum wage for over-25s is a step in the right direction, it is not calculated on the needs of the British people, and unhelpfully discriminates against those entering the workforce for the first years of their working lives. Workers on a government minimum currently earn \u00a37.83 hourly, based on 55% of median earnings in the UK. The real living wage campaign instead asks business owners to pay according to costs of living, with a higher rate in London, where costs are higher. It has the potential to pull 1.7 million people already working full-time out of poverty. Those of us on middle and higher incomes simply do not grasp the significance of this increase. For us, a tighter budget might mean one or two fewer coffees a week, or trimming back on our leisure activities and holidays. For those on minimum wage it is the difference between being able to feed the children well, buy new school shoes, or avoid a debt crisis. Many organisations from across the business spectrum have recognised this and now pay the real living wage \u2013 including my own diocese. My area is home to many thousands of hard-pressed families who have been hit by economic upheaval and the loss of industry. Communities look to new employers for jobs and prosperity \u2013 and established organisations can do their bit too. Close to my own home, I\u2019d like to see Newcastle United football club follow the example of Liverpool, who recently joined the real living wage movement. Today, I\u2019m celebrating those who do pay the living wage \u2013 and along with schools, churches, charities and fellow real living wage employers, asking questions of those who don\u2019t. \u2022 Paul Butler is the of Durham and children\u2019s advocate on behalf of bishops", "22||Lykke Li review \u2013 turning up the bombastic club vibesSigrid, M\u00d8, Alma, Tove Lo: Scandipop is in excellent health in 2018. And happily there\u2019s still space for its 90s and 00s progenitors, among them the still-reigning Robyn, Little Dragon and Lykke Li, who released her first record a decade ago this year. The Swedish singer has since released three more albums of introspective pop, and expanded into swaggering R&amp;B and trap on her latest, this year\u2019s So Sad So Sexy. At her first London show in four years, the stage is bathed in scarlet light, with a gigantic triangle and Li\u2019s eyes on the backdrop. Dressed top to toe in PVC and wielding a tambourine, she is a striking figure, and is soon propelling herself around, staging a dance break and explaining her crotch-grabbing choreography to the crowd as she struts purposefully. There\u2019s space for a clutch of tracks from 2014\u2019s balladeering I Never Learn, but largely the focus is on her latest work. Not that the show is one-note: the bombastic club vibes and syncopated strobes during Deep End contrast with a near-a cappella version of Bad Woman, during which her band retreat into the shadows. If Li\u2019s patter often feels generic (there are lots of appeals for the crowd to dance) then the show is the opposite, as she segues with ease and power from swelling beats to quasi-rap to torch songs, and even a hushed cover of Usher\u2019s U Got It Bad: unexpectedly, its admission that \u201cI\u2019ve been there, done it, fucked around \u2026 nobody wants to be alone\u201d feels right at home alongside her own songs. Li\u2019s sound is more mainstream and divisive than ever, cloaked in occasionally overbearing percussion and the odd awkward appeal to her \u201cbae\u201d. Yet it retains the heavy emotive core that\u2019s threaded throughout her past decade\u2019s work: on Better Alone, her newfound mettle meets stirring harmonies, fusing past and present.", "21||Guns and poses: Deutsche B\u00f6rse photography prize shortlist revealedThis year\u2019s Deutsche Borse photography prize shortlist is a considered choice of four artists whose approaches draw on documentary, archival appropriation and conceptualism. They are: Susan Meiselas for her retrospective exhibition, Mediations; Laia Abril for her deeply-researched book, On Abortion; Arwed Messmer for his archival exhibition, RAF: No Evidence and Mark Ruwedel for his show, The Artist and Society. Meiselas, an acclaimed Magnum veteran, is by far the best-known and most-renowned photographer on the shortlist and if the \u00a330,000 award were a documentary prize she would win, for a career that has seen her chronicle violent political upheaval in South America and the diaspora of the Kurds, as well as Italian-American teenagers in downtown New York. The Deutsche Borse prize does not tend to favour humanist documentary, though \u2013 British veteran Chris Killip lost out to the conceptual duo, Broomberg and Chanarin, back in 2013. Thus, the other female photographer on the shortlist, Abril, is perhaps better placed for her thought-provoking book, On Abortion, itself part of a bigger project called The History of Misogyny. Here, the archival, the documentary and the conceptual come together, as Abril constructs a powerful broadside against countries in which abortion is still illegal and examines why the risks to women\u2019s physical and psychological health are high and sometimes fatal. Which leaves Rudewel and Messmer, the former making photographs steeped in the conceptual formalist rigour of a certain kind of 1970s land art, the other trawling police and state archives to reconsider the violent legacy of the 70s German group, the Red Army Faction \u2013 better known as the Baader Meinhof gang. The contrast between the two \u2013 and indeed all four contenders \u2013 highlights the continuing dilemma of a prize \u2013 and indeed all photography prizes \u2013 not based on generic styles. How do you measure an artist who is solely using archival material against another who is documenting the impact of humans on landscapes, and, in the process, addressing the history and methodology of landscape photography? In the end, I suspect, personal taste will out. The shortlist acknowledges photographers whose work is \u201cperceived to uniquely address and expand the fluency and capabilities of the medium\u201d. On that basis, Abril, the youngest artist here and the only one nominated for a photobook, looks to be the likeliest winner. Her merging of styles and approaches \u2013 text, archival images, objects, testimony \u2013 combine to make work that is, in the current political climate, both topical and highly charged. Personally, I would have liked to have seen Sohrab Hura on the shortlist for his installation, The Lost Head and the Bird, which has a rare kind of visceral, edgy hallucinatory energy that is absent from the shortlist. This is a thought-provoking, if not entirely groundbreaking selection, that may reflect more the values of the jury \u2013 only one artist, and four director-curators \u2013 rather than the state of contemporary photography. \u2022 The winner of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse photography prize will be announced on 16 May 2019 at the Photographers\u2019 Gallery, London", "6||Wayne Rooney\u2019s England recall is a fudge the FA has got wrongIn September Wesley Sneijder sat on a sofa in the centre circle of the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam, after making what he had decided would be his final international appearance, against Peru, and was joined by his wife and children to watch highlights of his career. Heart-warming as the moment was, the fact a 34-year-old who plays for Al-Gharafa, the sixth-best team in Qatar, was able to dictate the terms of his departure was perhaps another indication of a Netherlands team in long-term decline, and of a nation happier to look backwards than forwards. International football rarely has room for sentiment and England have certainly never allowed even their greatest players to tie up their careers with a ribbon and a bow. When Sir Alf Ramsey picked his first squad after the disappointment of the 1970 World Cup, one name was notably absent. \u201cI do not think this is the end of my international career,\u201d Bobby Charlton said. \u201cPlayers have been left out of the England squad before and come back.\u201d This one never did. \u201cI still get a kick out of finding myself in the team,\u201d said Bobby Moore in June 1973. \u201cYou can never be certain of getting a game.\u201d He won two more caps, the last that November. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to step aside,\u201d David Beckham said in July 2010. \u201cI still believe I have a part to play.\u201d Fabio Capello, the England manager, disagreed. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said the following month, \u201cbut probably he is a little bit old.\u201d Tom Finney\u2019s farewell came in a 5-0 win over the Soviet Union in October 1958. \u201cFinney, who did not receive much of the ball, had a pretty thin time,\u201d was all the Guardian had to say of his performance. Stanley Matthews had gone a year earlier, after a 4-1 victory in Copenhagen. \u201cIt was a game of fits and starts, particularly by the forwards, and little was ever seen of Matthews,\u201d we wrote. And, indeed, nothing was ever seen of him again. With only one major prize in the nation\u2019s trophy cabinet, England internationals have rarely been able to enjoy a glorious farewell. Gary Lineker was substituted an hour into a European Championship humiliation in Sweden; Peter Shilton blundered in a World Cup third-place play-off; Steven Gerrard was left on the bench as Costa Rica dumped England out of the tournament in 2014. \u201cThis is exactly what I didn\u2019t want to happen, the exact way,\u201d he sniffed as he came to terms with the result, and the end of his international career. And yet suddenly England are giving Wayne Rooney an emotional farewell. It is a move that jars horribly both with the nation\u2019s hard-hearted history and with the ethos of the senior side\u2019s current manager. In September Gareth Southgate announced \u201ca fresh cycle of probably not going back to players who\u2019ve been in before\u201d. The claims of experienced strikers impressing in the Premier League, such as Watford\u2019s Troy Deeney, were dismissed. \u201cFor me, the next forward players that should be challenging are some of the younger ones,\u201d said Southgate. Now a door closed to as-yet uncapped players for whom the chance to play for their country even once would be the realisation of a dream and a reward for years of dedication, is opened to allow a 33-year-old with 119 caps to milk some artificial applause. Capello had come up with an identical idea when discussing the end of Beckham\u2019s career. \u201cI hope David will be OK to come and play his last game here at Wembley in the next friendly game,\u201d he said, \u201cto come and wave bye-bye to the crowd.\u201d It was an unplanned comment made in a television interview and the proposal was not greeted warmly at the Football Association, or by the player. Plans were made to include him in the squad to play France that November but Beckham would not, in any sense of the phrase, play ball, and sources told the press he would appear only if selected on merit. When an identical proposal was put to Rooney, two years after his last international appearance, he was \u201chumbled and hugely excited\u201d to accept. It takes an unusual personality to refuse the offer of a high-profile ego massage and Rooney cannot fairly be blamed for succumbing, particularly with his charity, the Wayne Rooney Foundation, to benefit from the match. But this turn of events reflects poorly on the FA \u2013 which two weeks before a low-key friendly, and six weeks after tickets went on sale, may have put commercial motivations above sporting ones \u2013 and suggests either Southgate\u2019s focus on youth has been insincere, or that the idea has been imposed on him. It is a terrible shame England have allowed so many fine players to stumble away from the international scene unnoticed or in disgrace but in sport it is essential to earn adulation through toil and triumph. It should not be irredeemably naive to suggest that neither charity nor economic convenience should have any place in the process.", "2||Stacey Abrams condemns Brian Kemp after he accuses Democrats of voter \u2018hack\u2019The Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia, Stacey Abrams, said on Monday her opponent had \u201cabused his power\u201d, a day after Brian Kemp, who is also Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, announced an unexplained investigation into alleged \u201ccybercrime\u201d by the state Democratic party. The Republican accused Democrats of attempting to \u201chack\u201d Georgia\u2019s online voter registration system but offered no evidence for the charge. Reports have since emerged that a private citizen uncovered a flaw in the voting system \u2013 which Kemp controls in his state role \u2013 which would allow anyone with access to an individual\u2019s personal information to alter that voter\u2019s record. \u201cI think, unfortunately, Secretary Kemp has not only abused his power, he has failed to do his job,\u201d Abrams said in an interview with ABC. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t deserve a promotion when you do not serve the people you\u2019ve been hired to serve.\u201d Abrams told CNN Kemp\u2019s investigation was a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d and said it was a \u201ccomplete and utter fabrication\u201d to say Democrats were involved. The news site WhoWhatWhy reported that a man claiming to be a Georgia resident had uncovered the flaw and alerted Georgia Democrats. The site reported that Democrats then shared the information with lawyers for Kemp and national intelligence officials. It was only after that, WhoWhatWhy reported, that Kemp announced he was opening an investigation into Democrats for hacking. The Georgia race has been tainted by accusations of voter suppression under Kemp and racially charged remarks directed at Abrams. If elected, Abrams would be the first non-white, non-male governor of Georgia and the first female African American governor in US history. On Saturday, it was reported that racist robocalls bankrolled by white supremacists were targeting Abrams and Oprah Winfrey, who has campaigned in the state. Kemp said the calls were \u201cvile\u201d but on Monday Abrams criticized his response. \u201cI think it\u2019s a little late for him to repudiate racist remarks, given that he stood with someone wearing an anti-Islam T-shirt, he refused to denounce the same man earlier,\u201d Abrams said, referring to a photo that showed Kemp standing with a man wearing a T-shirt claiming \u201cAllah is not God\u201d. Donald Trump, who has used incendiary language in his campaign appearances over the past few weeks, appeared with Kemp in Georgia on Sunday, at a rally which Kemp pulled out of a scheduled debate with Abrams to attend. The president accused Abrams, a Yale law school graduate who spent six years as minority leader of the Georgia house, of being \u201cnot qualified\u201d for the job. In Florida on Saturday, Trump also said Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate who would be the first black governor of Florida, who has also faced racist attack ads, was \u201cnot equipped\u201d for the job.", "13||MoD could face \u00a314bn budget shortfall, say auditorsGavin Williamson has come under pressure to deal with a potential \u00a314.8bn black hole in the Ministry of Defence\u2019s budget identified in a report by official auditors. The National Audit Office report says the MoD is in \u201creal danger\u201d of wasting taxpayers\u2019 money on equipment over the next 10 years. The findings will raise further questions about the MoD\u2019s financial management after a series of critical reports on the department\u2019s spending plans. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, which scrutinises NAO reports for parliament, said the MoD did not have enough money to buy the equipment it needed and was in danger of wasting money through short-term decision-making. \u201cThe announcement in the budget of an extra \u00a31bn for defence doesn\u2019t deal with the gap in the MoD\u2019s budget,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the ongoing financial pressures, the MoD need to be clear about what equipment they will or will not be funding.\u201d According to the report, the MoD\u2019s forecast costs exceed its budget of \u00a3186.4bn by \u00a37bn in the next 10 years. In a worst-case scenario, should all the identified risks occur, this gap could grow to \u00a314.8bn, it concludes. The NAO recommends that the MoD should decide which programmes to defer or drop as soon as possible and then \u201coutline its decisions, including the financial and broader implications, to parliament.\u201d It says the MoD should stop deferring projects where it leads to higher costs in later years. \u201cThese [deferred projects] included delaying by two years its programme to introduce new remotely piloted aircraft (Protector), resulting in an estimated \u00a3160m cost increase, and delaying some Typhoon training by one year, which increased costs by \u00a36 million,\u201d the report says. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said the MoD\u2019s equipment plan for 2018-28 showed that the ministry had a clearer understanding of the affordability issues it faced, but also \u201cshows how urgently it needs to get on and tackle them\u201d. The defence minister Stuart Andrew said spending was 3.7% over budget in the next decade and he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for the NAO\u2019s report. He said ministers would be \u201crigorously pursuing productivity and efficiency gains\u201d and \u201cprioritising capabilities to meet the changing threat environment\u201d. He told MPs: \u201cThis forecast will vary as risks and opportunities materialise and project plans mature or are changed through management action.\u201d", "23||Baudelaire suicide letter fetches three times estimated price at auctionAn \u201cextraordinary\u201d letter in which the 19th-century French poet Charles Baudelaire tells his lover of his plans to kill himself has sold at auction for three times more than was anticipated. Baudelaire, author of the poetry collection Les Fleurs du Mal, was 24 when he wrote the letter, on 30 June 1845. In debt, and unsure about his literary prowess, he told his mistress, Jeanne Duval, who inspired much of his poetry, that \u201cby the time you receive this letter, I will be dead\u201d. \u201cI am killing myself because I can no longer live, because the exhaustion of going to sleep and the exhaustion of waking up are unbearable to me. I am killing myself because I believe myself to be immortal, and I hope for it,\u201d he wrote. Baudelaire did attempt suicide that day, but was unsuccessful. The writer went on to live for another 22 years, and died at the age of 46 in 1867. According to the French auction house Osenat, which sold the letter on 4 November, it is \u201cwithout doubt the most extraordinary letter from Baudelaire in private hands\u201d. Osenat had estimated that the letter would sell for between \u20ac60,000 and \u20ac80,000, but it was acquired by a private buyer for \u20ac234,000 (\u00a3205,000).

In the infancy of his tenure but already desperate for a result, Stuttgart\u2019s coach Markus Weinzierl would have hoped for opponents without that type of focus as his team opened the Bundesliga weekend at an anxious Mercedes-Benz Arena on Friday night. Unfortunately, he and they bumped into Eintracht Frankfurt instead. Few expected this to be much of a season for last term\u2019s DfB Pokal winners after Niko Kovac\u2019s departure for Bayern Munich even if his replacement, Adi H\u00fctter, was coming off a Swiss Super League win with Young Boys \u2013 but recent weeks have raised hopes. Still, they had been stretched by a couple of injuries before travelling south, with the experienced defender Marco Russ and midfielder Mijat Gacinovic both staying home in Frankfurt with injuries. It left them down to the bare bones at the back, so H\u00fctter decided the best form of defence was attack, replacing Gacinovic with a striker, S\u00e9bastien Haller \u2013 putting the Frenchman in the starting lineup with Ante Rebic and Luka Jovic for the first time. Following last week\u2019s 1-1 draw with N\u00fcrnberg \u2013 after the visit to Stuttgart, it\u2019s the only time Eintracht have failed to win in their last seven matches \u2013 there was a palpable sense of irritation around the squad, with only substitute Haller\u2019s late goal saving a point. Higher standards have been set and, primed by H\u00fctter\u2019s team selection and tactical desires, they took it out on poor Stuttgart. Eintracht pushed hard from the start, with only VAR bailing out the home side after Rebic had appeared to give the visitors the lead a few minutes in before being correctly ruled offside. Yet even the manner of that finish, with Rebic outrageously rolling a dummy around goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler before tapping into an empty net, underlined just how confident his team was. Before long they were doing it for real, with Haller scoring the first and Jovic setting up Rebic for the second before the break. By the time substitutes Jetro Willems and Nicolai M\u00fcller combined for a late third, H\u00fctter\u2019s side were cruising. This sort of ballsy, best-foot-first plan is not at all out of character for Eintracht this season. With Stuttgart suffering their worst ever start to a Bundesliga season, having now lost seven of their first 10 - and Weinzierl\u2019s record since taking over reading three matches, three defeats, no goals scored and 11 conceded \u2013 they were clearly perfect cannon fodder for a team on the crest of a wave. In a private moment, H\u00fctter would be sure to sympathise with Stuttgart and Weinzierl. As a player, he had the chance to join 1860 Munich in the 90s but decided to stay at Salzburg. \u201cI told myself that if I ever had the chance again to come to Germany, I\u2019d take it,\u201d he said in pre-season, but his start was more nightmare than long-held dream. The vagaries of the German fixture calendar can be tough on a new coach, with Pokal matches preceding the first fixture of the Bundesliga season. It can be a handy warmup \u2013 or, if you lose to lower-league opposition, it can pile the pressure on before you really get started. \u201cWe have to get the fans on our side,\u201d H\u00fctter had said on the eve of their Pokal match, with little sense of the sporting catastrophe on the horizon. A reverse against fourth-tier Ulm, which followed on directly from a 5-0 Super Cup humiliation at home by Bayern and Kovac, meant the holders were ousted after barely a lap celebrating with the trophy. The contrast with Kovac\u2019s start was significant. In pre-season, H\u00fctter and the sporting director Bruno H\u00fcbner were split between lining up in a 4-4-2 or retaining the three-man defence generally favoured by Kovac. \u201cIf it was an easy transition [from Kovac],\u201d H\u00fcbner said in August, \u201cthen we wouldn\u2019t have needed a coach. I\u2019d have done it myself.\u201d The leap from Kovac to H\u00fctter was tough to negotiate. As 11 Freunde\u2019s Tobias Escher wrote in September, there was some alarm even after the new coach got the monkey off his back, winning 2-0 at Freiburg immediately after the humiliation at Ulm. Freiburg had 22 shots in that match, something that had happened to Eintracht only twice in two years under Kovac. Under the Croatian they had faced the third-fewest number of shots in the Bundesliga in 2016-17 and the sixth-fewest last season. Anybody even loosely familiar with Young Boys\u2019 glorious romp to a first Swiss title in 32 years knew that was highly unlikely to be the case under H\u00fctter. He likes his team to press hard, attack and he certainly won\u2019t chide them for taking risks. Commuting style would need time and confidence, two things that instantly diminished after those bad opening two results. They were also missing Kevin-Prince Boateng, who had been a leader on and off the pitch before exiting for Sassuolo. H\u00fctter responded in the only way he knew how \u2013 by continuing to go for the jugular. Winning at Marseille\u2019s Stade V\u00e9lodrome on the Europa League opening night gave Eintracht confidence and the coach credit, and the team have rolled with it since. Haller and Jovic in particular have looked unstoppable \u2013 the Frenchman already has seven goals in the Bundesliga having got nine in the whole of his debut season \u2013 and while the relative lack of clean sheets is apparently irritating the returned Kevin Trapp, who was delighted with Friday\u2019s shut-out, few are complaining. That Europe proved the springboard is apt for a club with considerable history. At the Sportpresseball in the city on Saturday, Eintracht named half a dozen new \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d \u2013 Jay Jay Okocka, Tony Yeboah, Cha Bum-Kun, Jan-Aage Fj\u00f6rtoft, Oka Nikolov and Chen Yang, with the first five of those attending the presentation. It underlined just what a past this club has. Now, if they win at Apollon Limassol on Thursday, Eintracht will already have clinched a place in the last 32 of the Europa League. For Stuttgart, loudly whistled off at half-time and again at full-time, such heights feel a million miles away even if \u2013 had Eintracht not unexpectedly beaten Bayern in May\u2019s Pokal final \u2013 it would be them in Europe instead. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this,\u201d said Zieler afterwards, knowing their visit to N\u00fcrnberg on Saturday afternoon already couldn\u2019t be more vital. H\u00fctter, one imagines, would simply counsel Weinzierl to simply be brave. Talking points \u2022 Next weekend\u2019s Der Klassiker is well set from all angles. Dortmund\u2019s 1-0 win at Wolfsburg and Bayern\u2019s concession of a late leveller at home to Freiburg makes the gap four points \u2013 meaning BVB could go into the international break seven clear with a win. \u2022 The feeling that Der Klassiker could be vital was reinforced by the inconsistency elsewhere, with Hoffenheim riding roughshod over Leverkusen after the latter\u2019s big win at Werder Bremen last weekend, and Leipzig getting an impressive 3-0 victory at Hertha.", "22||Headie One review \u2013 a feelgood celebration despite the bleak lyrics\u2018Let\u2019s get the joint jumping,\u201d urges Headie One, gazing over a surging mosh pit reminiscent of a hardcore gig crowd. His first national tour may be taking place against the odds, but his gigs are sold out, the venues upgraded and he\u2019s getting the sort of audience reactions that often greet a rapidly emerging new youth movement. The 24-year-old Broadwater Farm estate MC is at the forefront of the UK\u2019s drill music \u2013 a Chicago-originated, much slower version of grime, with violent, nihilistic lyrics \u2013 which has been linked by the authorities to London\u2019s knife crime and triggered a tabloid moral panic akin to those that greeted punk or acid house. Drill gigs have been closed down by police, YouTube videos deleted, and one act has even been restricted by police in their ability to make music. And yet, here, the scenes are good natured and celebratory as the mostly teenage audience get to experience the music behind the headlines and a former prison inmate turned artist who doesn\u2019t stop grinning all night. The euphoria makes for a strange disconnect with the bleakly compelling music, in which eerily sluggish beats are counterbalanced by dazzling wordplay and catchy hooks, peppered by sounds of breaking glass and gunshots. Police-car wails introduce Sirens, a haunting tale of \u201cGrowing up, all you ever hear is sirens.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t read the lyrics of Different Sorts to your mum \u2013 \u201cGuns, money, drugs, that\u2019s the shit I\u2019m into\u201d \u2013 but his words reflect realities of inner city life with vivid observations and, occasionally, humour. \u201cI\u2019m upfront like Costa.

When I met Miguel Indur\u00e1in he got embarrassed. I don\u2019t like it when people do it to me. I say, \u2018I\u2019ve moved on. He\u2019s gone now, that person.\u2019\u201d The book is called Icons. It\u2019s rather beautiful and an intriguing blend of cycling history and personal snippets which offer insight into Wiggins\u2019 contradictions. The \u201cproper nerd\u201d he used to be, as a cycling-obsessed teenager living on a London council estate, shines through some endearing pages about the bike riders who consumed him when he fell for a brutal and complicated sport. Yet it is striking that a man steeped in cycling history should avoid acknowledging in the book that Icons features many dopers. Wiggins, instead, writes that \u201cromance is the soul of cycling.\u201d The romance, however, has been stripped by allegations and denials of cheating \u2013 and by open confessions of persistent doping. Wiggins\u2019 own story is tarnished. His life is nothing like it was in 2012, when he won the Tour de France and Olympic gold while being celebrated as a British icon who could do little wrong. In March 2018 a parliamentary culture, media and sport select committee published a devastating report which claimed Team Sky had abused the anti-doping system and allowed Wiggins to use triamcinolone before the 2012 Tour. The report concluded that Sky had \u201ccrossed an ethical line\u201d in obtaining therapeutic use exemption forms to enable Wiggins to take triamcinolone which, apart from helping his asthma, enhanced his power-to-weight ratio. Sky and Wiggins reject the charge. The impasse has taken its toll with no one able to prove whether or not triamcinolone had been sent in Sky\u2019s notorious Jiffy bag. But, first, we discuss his book and the choice to mention doping only in passing. \u201cIt\u2019s not a book about that,\u201d Wiggins says. \u201cThere are greater people, with more powers, that can do something [about doping].\u201d As an ardent collector of cycling memorabilia, Wiggins estimates \u201cI could make a phone call tomorrow and sell the whole collection for half a million.\u201d But his love of cycling has been regenerated by the book, which features evocative items given to him by the chosen Icons. \u201cCycling means the world to me and I\u2019ve gone back, no chains attached. No political correctness. I\u2019m not with a team that\u2019s agenda-led \u2013 or want me to be careful about mentioning Lance Armstrong. I say what I like. It\u2019s good to go back to when I fell in love with cycling aged 13. Growing up in Kilburn I could have ended up somewhere very different. Some would say I\u2019d have been better off being killed or in prison.\u201d Wiggins looks up. \u201cI was a kid living in Kilburn in the early 1990s, with pictures of Belgian cyclists on my wall. There has probably never been a kid in Kilburn, before or since, who had a bedroom wall like that.\u201d Life has changed joltingly since he won the Tour. \u201cMy kids have suffered,\u201d Wiggins says. \u201cWe had to move schools and then all the stuff broke with Lance in 2013 [when Armstrong finally admitted to doping] and the kids started getting it.\u201d Everything became worse two years ago when Fancy Bears hackers released documents showing Wiggins had been given permission to use triamcinolone, a banned corticosteroid, for medical reasons with the appropriate TUEs, before races in 2011, 2012 and 2013. \u201cPeople have free rein to put their own facts in place. Kids read headlines and their parents say things about you. You end up saying to your kids: \u2018Just tell them to fucking do one.\u2019 They do and it\u2019s your kids in trouble. \u201cThen the BBC show up on your doorstep and you can\u2019t take your kids to school. You tell the BBC, \u2018I can\u2019t talk to you, because there\u2019s an investigation.\u2019 They just want to know about the packages. The whole thing becomes an uncontrolled trial by media. In any other court it would be thrown out because the media have skewed the facts. \u201cYou watch your family suffer, and it\u2019s terrible. It nearly killed my wife [Cath]. She ended up in rehab over it. I\u2019m at home having to deal with it. Because she\u2019s bi-polar she has this fear of shame, people watching her all the time. You couldn\u2019t say that at the time because you\u2019ve asked for it, because you\u2019ve won the Tour de France. No, I didn\u2019t ask for that actually. I only asked for a fair trial.\u201d These personal words about his family provide a salutary reminder to those who have been so vehement. An ordinary family has been scorched but there is also hope when I ask how Cath is today. \u201cReally good now. She\u2019s moving on.\u201d Wiggins\u2019s anger is still palpable. \u201cWhat I should have done,\u201d he says, \u201cis murder someone because then I\u2019d have had proper rights. I\u2019d have had more rights as a murderer. There\u2019d have been no articles and I\u2019d have had a fair trial. I\u2019d have been cleared or found guilty. Not somewhere in the middle where you can\u2019t find any evidence of wrongdoing.\u201d Has Wiggins accepted his name has been tainted? \u201cYeah. I understand that not everyone\u2019s going to like you. I don\u2019t like everyone. It\u2019s made me be myself more and say what I think.\u201d Will the truth ever be established \u2013 especially as Wiggins said earlier this year that \u201cvery sinister\u201d details surrounded the Jiffy-bag scandal and he would \u201clove it to come out.\u201d He nods. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more going on than I alluded to this summer. I can\u2019t prove any of it yet. It might take five years and, in the interim, I\u2019m carrying on with my life.\u201d \u2018I talk to Lance Armstrong fairly regularly\u2019 I am a sucker for many of the book\u2019s stories. Wiggins\u2019s first chosen icon is Johan Museeuw, the Belgian who won both Paris-Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders on three separate occasions. Flanders was the first race Wiggins watched, live on Eurosport in 1993, when he was 13. Museeuw won and Brad was thrilled because, in those pre-internet days, he usually had to wait until Cycling Weekly arrived at his local newsagent on a Thursday to find out who had won Flanders the previous weekend. In 1996 Wiggins and his brother were taken by their mum to see Museeuw race in Flanders. Wiggins was almost beside himself but, being 16, he was \u201ctoo cool for school\u201d. He forced his eight-year-old brother to approach the cyclists. \u201cHe was acting as a proxy for me because I didn\u2019t want to come across as the smitten, star-struck teenager I was.\u201d At his final Tour of Flanders, in 2015, Wiggins stressed how much Museeuw had meant to him. They swapped messages on Instagram. Museeuw\u2019s 15-year-old son was a Wiggins fan and the circle was complete. The only problem was that when they met, and Museeuw gave him his 1993 jersey, Wiggins felt like a tongue-tied teenager again while the middle-aged icon had a high-pitched voice which \u201cseemed the opposite of the ferocious rider he\u2019d once been.\u201d It\u2019s a lovely story but Wiggins looks surprised when I ask him why he does not mention Museeuw\u2019s confession in 2007 that he \u201cdid not play the game honestly\u201d and, like most cyclists of his era, had used EPO. In a 2012 Cycling Weekly interview Museeuw said of doping: \u201cWe must break with the hypocrisy. The only way to come out of that murderous spiral is to break the silence that haunts us.\u201d Surely Wiggins could follow his boyhood hero and write honestly about cycling\u2019s dark history? \u201cI didn\u2019t because I\u2019ve gone back to when I was 13 and didn\u2019t know about EPO. I took all that out, not because I condone it, but because I can\u2019t change who inspired me. I was inspired by their feats on the bike and the memories of them coming into the velodrome at Roubaix regardless of whether they were on EPO. In hindsight, they probably were. But it was like, \u2018Fuck me, this is what I want to do. I have to get out of Kilburn and live in Belgium.\u201d Armstrong\u2019s doping has been documented so thoroughly I can\u2019t feel outraged by his presence in Wiggins\u2019 book. But Wiggins suggests that, \u201cHenri Desgrange, the \u2018father of the Tour\u2019, envisaged a \u2018perfect winner\u2019\u2026 a super athlete who would not only defeat his opponents but whatever nature might throw at him \u2026 it explains why Tour winners tended to be masochistic, obsessive and, on occasion, borderline sociopathic.\u201d Wiggins concludes that Armstrong was \u201cprecisely the sort of winner Desgrange had in mind 120 years ago.\u201d Are he and Armstrong close today? \u201cNot in terms of being really friendly but we have mutual respect. I talk to him fairly regularly.\u201d Has Armstrong suffered more than other dopers? \u201cPerhaps not. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s suffered enough. But in other ways he has. I went to the US last month, to ride George Hincapie\u2019s Gran Fondo [a charity race], and asked Lance, \u2018Are you going?\u2019 He said he\u2019s not allowed to ride sanctioned events. It\u2019s harsh that he can\u2019t ride around the back of a group with his mates. He\u2019s 47, he\u2019s not going to try to win a Scott bike at Gran Fondo. In terms of coming back to the sport, a life ban is fair enough but banning him across the board is too much.\u201d What does he think of Armstrong\u2019s podcast? \u201cI love it. It\u2019s brilliant. He\u2019s not frightened to say what he thinks. The trouble with cycling now is that too many people have an agenda or are not allowed to show who they are. Peter Sagan\u2019s holding the sport up. He\u2019s got the personality but he\u2019s not very articulate. He\u2019s like a child trapped in an adult\u2019s body. Sagan is a genius on a bike but we need more personalities. G [Geraint Thomas] has the personality. He\u2019s a lovely, really funny guy but the shackles are on him with Sky. You can\u2019t say what you think.\u201d We return to the subject of doping and Icons. Both Jacques Anquetil, the first man to win the Tour de France five times in the 1960s, and Fausto Coppi, who twice won the double of the Giro d\u2019Italia and the Tour in 1949 and 1952, admitted they had doped at a time when there was little scrutiny of such habits. Anquetil said: \u201cLeave me in peace. Everybody takes dope.\u201d \u2018Regardless of what we think of each other, Froome\u2019s a great\u2019 Wiggins reiterates his romantic reasons for glossing over this truth. And yet, writing about another of his heroes, Indur\u00e1in, Wiggins states: \u201cHe rode during the EPO years and yet he\u2019s the Tour winner that nobody has ever gone after \u2026 Indur\u00e1in\u2019s morality is bomb-proof.\u201d The Spaniard tested positive for salbutamol in 1994 but the head of the IOC\u2019s medical commission led the defence by stressing that Indur\u00e1in needed the prescribed and legitimate medication for his asthma. He was cleared. Even though he remains in the records books as an unequivocally clean cyclist who was never banned, Indur\u00e1in\u2019s reputation has been questioned repeatedly by dubious fans. Indur\u00e1in has always denied any wrongdoing at any stage of his career. \u201cHe is described as the perfect gentleman\u201d Wiggins says of Indur\u00e1in. \u201cYou could find him in bed with your wife and he\u2019d give you a hug. He\u2019d make you think it was your idea. He was just that kind of fellow, such a nice person. I don\u2019t think he had one enemy in the peloton. He gifted people stages because it was enough for him to win the Tour. He wasn\u2019t greedy.\u201d Indur\u00e1in might have been a gentleman but, after riding six Tours with limited impact, he won five in a row. Cynics point to the widespread use of EPO in that period. Is it possible that Indur\u00e1in might have cheated? \u201cI don\u2019t know. You have to think, in that time, maybe he was. But until he gets caught you assume he wasn\u2019t. This just comes from the heart of his reign when I was aged 11 to 15. I\u2019m writing it from my teenage [perspective].\u201d Indur\u00e1in\u2019s supporters, like a young Wiggins, appear even more certain of his innocence. So does it irk Wiggins that Froome, his former rival at Sky, could join Anquetil and Indur\u00e1in by winning a fifth Tour next year? \u201cNot at all. Chris is a great athlete and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll do it. I don\u2019t think G can match him in the climbs. G\u2019s great on the cobblestones but an on-form Chris beats him. Regardless of what we think of each other as people, he\u2019ll go down as, if not the greatest of his generation, one of the best.\u201d Wiggins is scathing towards Dave Brailsford \u2013 his former boss at Sky. He loves Sean Yates, a former team-mate of Armstrong who also worked for Team Sky and helped Wiggins win the Tour in 2012. Yates was eased out of Sky in October 2012. \u201cThey said his health was the reason but they got rid of him because of the association with Lance. That\u2019s typical Dave and Sky. As long as it looks good on paper, fuck what it\u2019s actually like behind the scenes.\u201d Wiggins sees the threads of history tying him, Froome and Thomas, as Tour winners, to great riders of the past. \u201cWe watched Geraint win the Tour and saw Sky take a six-storey office block of a bus. Dave\u2019s got his own mobile home that he sleeps in. Think of Coppi winning the Tour in 1949. The last three stages were 900km. The last stage into Paris was 350km. It took them 12 hours to do it. You didn\u2019t get into a bus then or talk about marginal gains. You didn\u2019t do a warm-down before the podium. Fuck the warm-down. I\u2019ve just done 350km. \u201cBut for all the differences we\u2019re in the same club as Coppi. We won the Tour and we\u2019re steeped in that unique history. As much as the sport has changed we\u2019re still trekking across the mountains in France, maybe on better bikes, better equipment, better roads, bigger crowds. It\u2019s still the same climbs. But I sense Coppi\u2019s greatness. You imagine little towns in the Dolomites that wouldn\u2019t get newspapers or TV. They would hear that Coppi was coming past. People would put the wheelbarrows down and come out to get a glimpse of Coppi. There\u2019s something beautiful about that.\u201d All our debate over doping and heartache has disappeared. Wiggins leans forward and says: \u201cCoppi, Anquetil and [Hugo] Koblet all had fucking nice hair. They carried combs in their back pocket. There\u2019s a picture of Koblet in the yellow jersey, a towel round him, combing his hair. They all combed their hair as soon as they crossed the line because that\u2019s where the photos were taken. Brilliant.\u201d Wiggins seems happy again but how will he spend his immediate future? \u201cI\u2019m doing this one-man tour onstage about the book [An Evening with Bradley Wiggins from 12-19 November]. Going around the country. I\u2019ll tell stories, a bit of comedy. Some impressions.\u201d Won\u2019t he be nervous? \u2018No. I\u2019ll be great. Being myself is enough.\u201d What will he do if, shortly before his first performance, all the past pain rises up again? Wiggins sinks back in his chair and smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll just have a bottle of red. A bottle of wine changes the world.\u201d Icons: My Inspiration. My Motivation. My Obsession by Bradley Wiggins is published by HarperCollins and available now", "20||The Front Runner: the truth behind Hugh Jackman's scandalous new filmThe good old days. When a new president could tell a group of reporters: \u201cOne more thing, boys. You may see me coming in and out of a few women\u2019s bedrooms while I am in the White House, but just remember, that is none of your business.\u201d The good old days, when politicians (mostly all men) could get drunk with journalists (ditto) without fretting about potential sexual indiscretions being revealed (or committed) because there was an understanding about all that. The good old days, when a 50-year-old married US senator, running for president, might have invited a 29-year-old model-actor he first met at Don Henley\u2019s house to spend a weekend with him in Washington, and expect discretion on all sides. Except when Gary Hart did that, in May 1987, the good old days \u2013 as soon became explosively clear \u2013 were already ending. The Front Runner, a new film about Hart\u2019s 1988 presidential candidacy and its ignominious collapse, is a pained love letter to the good old days, a morality tale in which the ostensible transgressor turns out to be the victim, and his self-appointed judge and jury \u2013 the media \u2013 are in fact the culprits. In the film, the media is guilty for betraying the old gentleman\u2019s agreement that for decades meant that a president such as John Kennedy or Lyndon Johnson could shtup whichever personal assistant or job applicant he wanted, and the last thing that would happen would be that somebody would write it up. To do so would be stupid, nay offensive, because no one would care, and it would be prurient, and distract everyone from the very important, dignified matters at hand, matters of government. It would be like transcribing locker room talk, writing it up as news \u2013 pure tabloid stuff. The movie is based on a book by the former New York Times politics writer Matt Bai and stars Hugh Jackman as Hart, Vera Farmiga as his wife and JK Simmons as his campaign manager. Jason Reitman (Up in the Air, Juno, Thank You for Smoking) directed. The title is an allusion to Hart\u2019s status as the front-runner early on in the 1988 race for the Democratic presidential nomination and to the Hart sex scandal being a forerunner for the burning hellscape of trash that now defines our politico-media reality. It\u2019s a fun movie, with romantic depictions of a caffeine-fueled political campaign and smoke-filled newsrooms, vivid performances, a bunch of wittily inserted vintage news footage and delightful 1980s props like gigantic portable phones, a Kodak Ektra camera, a Jeep Renegade, Ritz crackers, high hair and high-waisted jeans. But as widely noted when Bai\u2019s book was published in 2014, the thesis \u2013 that the Hart scandal was unprecedented, that the media was wrong to pursue the story of Hart\u2019s alleged womanizing and that doing so set off an irreversible slide into tabloidism and the dumbing-down of politics, in short ruining everything \u2013 is superficial and sketchy. Tom Rosenstiel, the executive director of the American Press Institute, who in 1987 investigated the media\u2019s conduct in the Hart affair for the Los Angeles Times, said in an email that he admired Bai greatly, \u201cbut I lived through this one and the book is wrong. So, I fear, will be this film, doing a disservice to the truth even by Hollywood definition.\u201d \u201cGary Hart was no martyr,\u201d Rosenstiel wrote in part. \u201cAsk any one of 500 sources in Washington in politics (not even the media) from that time who weren\u2019t in the tiny camp of Hart acolytes. The Senator did himself in. And if it hadn\u2019t been Donna Rice it would have been not only many other women but many other character tics and moments of unthinkable risk-taking or self-delusion.\u201d Hart was a two-term senator from Colorado who had made a strong run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and who in the early stages of the 1988 race \u2013 nine months ahead of the Iowa caucuses \u2013 was polling ahead of his rivals. Hart was a big-picture visionary with the intellectual horsepower to navigate and manipulate the minutiae and the political talent to present his ideas to the public, and he looked good in skinny jeans, which has been relevant in politics since at least the days of the Kennedys, to whom Hart was sometimes compared. But from certain angles, Hart did not look like a strong candidate. He bridled at photoshoots and other campaign set pieces. He could come across as arrogant and aloof. He had changed his name and there was some confusion about his age. He had been separated a couple times from his wife and was raised in a deeply conservative religious household in Kansas, but became a political sex symbol as manager of George McGovern\u2019s 1972 campaign. When anyone asked him about his personal background he bristled. (Bristled, yes, but the real Hart was not known to bark with rage at reporters as Jackman, whose hair is nowhere near as good as Hart\u2019s, does repeatedly in the movie. For the once-pious Hart, \u201canger was \u2026 unworthy, like swearing, or the sin of pride,\u201d wrote Richard Ben Cramer in his definitive study of Hart in his masterpiece What It Takes.) Also, Hart was a reputed womanizer. Did all that make Hart unfit for the presidency? Probably not? But did the bristling make the questions go away? Definitely not. \u201cHart had gravitated since \u201984 toward hedonists such as Warren Beatty, who became his sidekick and used fixers to find him girls,\u201d Gail Sheehy wrote at the time in her Vanity Fair piece The Road to Bimini. \u201cThat led him to Turnberry Isle, the Miami resort where Lynn Armandt, proprietor of the on-site bikini store, was more than happy to provide girls like Rice for cruises on a pleasure vessel named Monkey Business.\u201d The media went about 10ft before they caught Rice, the model turned pharmaceuticals sales rep, flying up from Miami to visit Hart, although both parties denied any untoward conduct. Hart did not drop out of the race immediately upon the exposure of his friendship with Rice, or upon the publication of the memorable photo of Rice in Hart\u2019s lap with Hart wearing a T-shirt that said Monkey Business Crew. Hart dropped out after Ben Bradlee, the legendary Washington Post editor, checked with a friend in Washington about whether a separate affair that Hart was allegedly conducting was the real thing (the Post had photos), and the answer came back in the affirmative. The Post confronted Hart, who said he was withdrawing from the race, and Bradlee never published \u2013 the old gentleman\u2019s agreement not entirely effaced. The thesis of Bai\u2019s book and of the movie is that by poking into Hart\u2019s personal life, the press fell short of its sacred charge and ruined the trust between politicians and the media, ending informal contact between the two sides (those drinks) and thereby destroying the quality of politics coverage, which used to be about the issues but became a mix of generic sound bites and tabloid coverage. Had the media refused to chase the womanizing rumors, the thesis suggests, we would not now be saddled with Fox News, Twitter, \u201cfake news\u201d and that ultimate unholy union of tabloid sludge and political power, our current president. If the thesis looked questionable in 2014, it is borderline appalling in 2018. Here\u2019s one story that didn\u2019t make it into the movie, recounted in Cramer\u2019s book. It was during the 1984 campaign. Hart was winning big and the entire media wanted him. Hart agreed to a late-night interview in his hotel room with a young, attractive Knight-Ridder reporter, Patricia O\u2019Brien. He answered the door in a short bathrobe, \u201cand she knew he had nothing else on\u201d. She told him he made her uncomfortable and asked him to put on clothes. \u201cAnd Hart \u2026 he got huffy, like it was her dirty mind,\u201d recounts Cramer. As a flip side to his alleged libertinism, Hart was a moral scold. When his campaign blew up in 1988, he told a Denver Post reporter: \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to clean up your profession, my friend, or it\u2019s going to drive anyone that\u2019s got an ounce of integrity out.\u201d A politician said that! As #MeToo indelibly revealed, the good old days were not equally good for everyone. The same sexual dalliances, including sexual harassment, that the media was declining to report on in the world of politics was happening in the newsrooms, too, with a parallel culture of male power and impunity. And it was happening in business, the domain of Donald Trump, who knew, as Billy Bush knew, what it was OK for men to say and do. If there was a problem with the media\u2019s coverage of the Trump candidacy (not a bold conjecture), there is a strong argument that the media made a kind of anti-Hart error, that the coverage was not personal enough \u2013 it did not wade far enough into the toxic waste of Trump\u2019s personal life, his businesses, his taxes, his views on race, his marriages. The media coverage of candidate Trump included endless live footage of Trump\u2019s speeches, but in those pre-#MeToo days, the allegations of sexual assault and harassment brought against Trump by 20 women were largely passed over in favor of investigations into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email hygiene. There is no debating that the national politics is a mess in which the media writ large is complicit. But it seems kind of wacky to forage for the locus of this mess in the Hart affair \u2013 as opposed to, say, Roger Ailes\u2019 biography or the invention of the internet. \u201cThe biggest flaw in Bai\u2019s what-if fantasy, which includes Gary Hart being easily elected and there being no Iraq war, and on and on and on ... is that Gary Hart was almost certainly not going to be elected,\u201d wrote Rosenstiel. \u201cThis incident, this woman, and the various other odd edges about Hart were all clearly in the sights of [the late political strategist] Lee Atwater and the GOP. And Hart was utterly unprepared politically or psychologically to defend himself for the activities, personal and political, that they were going to attack him for. \u201cThere is so much more to this story than blaming the media. It is sad that we have journalists trying to re-litigate what happened and getting it wrong. It might make for a nice myth. But it ain\u2019t good history.\u201d The Front Runner is released in the US on 6 November and in the UK on 11 January", "0||Cameroon: 79 pupils kidnapped from boarding schoolSuspected secessionists in Cameroon have kidnapped dozens of pupils from a boarding school in an attack reminiscent of Boko Haram\u2019s abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria in 2014. The attackers arrived at Presbyterian secondary school Nkwen in Bamenda, the capital of the English-speaking north-west region, on Sunday night. They kidnapped more than 80 people, including the principal, a teacher and a driver, as well as 79 students, according to the regional administrator. Security guards who usually man the entrance to the school were nowhere to be seen, sources said. One student, who witnessed the attack but was left behind, described being woken up in the middle of the night by about seven armed men who beat and slapped the children as they made them leave their dormitories. \u201cThey knocked on the door and we opened it, even though we did not really know the people who were knocking,\u201d the student told the Guardian. \u201cSome of us were hesitating but others quickly opened [it]. When they came in, all of us went under our beds. They asked us to come outside. As we went outside, they started beating some of us, slapping them. \u201cThey tried to bump into another dormitory but it didn\u2019t open. They threatened the students to open the door or else they would be shot. All the other dorms heeded the threat. \u201cThey brought us to the administrative block and brought in the principal. They selected some students and asked us to lie on the ground. We laid there till morning. They asked us that before 5pm, all of us should go back home. They threatened to return to campus and kill those they will meet still here.\u201d A teacher who lived by the school said he heard sounds of an attack but did not venture out, fearing for his safety. \u201cI heard a strong sound at night, like that of a gun. I was scared,\u201d said Julius Nyamboli. \u201cWe quickly switched off the lights and went to bed. In the morning, I saw many people returning from campus with doubtful faces. I quickly rushed there and realised that students were not on campus.\u201d Both boys and girls had been taken from their dormitories, said another staff member who arrived in the morning to find the school in chaos. \u201cThe children were all in panic. We played our role to calm them down,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried to assemble the children. We took them to the chapel for morning devotion and carried out the roll-call, to ascertain who was there or not. Before we finished, the military interrupted.\u201d Soldiers began verifying how many students had been kidnapped. News was trickling back to parents of the abducted children as staff held a crisis meeting on Monday. \u201cI am very confused. I am all alone,\u201d said one woman, a widow whose 16-year-old daughter was taken. \u201cI went to the school and she was not on campus. I can\u2019t even talk. I just want them to free my daughter. She is innocent.\u201d Another mother, whose 15-year-old son was among the abductees, was preparing to travel from the capital of Yaound\u00e9 to Bamenda to pick up her other two children from the school. \u201cI am so devastated. I am just too stressed. I can\u2019t even believe this,\u201d she said. Like most of the parents and teachers, she asked not to be named for safety reasons. \u201cThe school has asked us to be calm, [and said] that they will get back to us,\u201d she said. Sources say the kidnappers have not yet asked for any ransom, but want the school to send the remaining students home before they release the abductees. Most schools in English-speaking Cameroon have been shut down since December 2016, when an uprising began. The authorities\u2019 violent crackdown on peaceful protesters demonstrating about the use of French in classrooms and courts in the English-speaking regions escalated the crisis, and rebel groups are now pitted against the army. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced and many more live in fear. The schools that are still functioning have been doing so despite threats, which pushed many Christian schools to host displaced students from other schools, as was the case with Nkwen. A similar incident took place in September in nearby Bafut, where nine students were kidnapped from another Presbyterian-owned boarding school by suspected secessionists, as the academic year started. The students spent three days in captivity, after which, according to family members, they were released on ransoms of 1m CFA francs (\u00a31,330). The student interviewed said that the kidnappers had pointed out the difference between their living conditions and that of the rebels. \u201cOne of them said our parents are sending us to school while they are suffering, sleeping in the bushes, while we are sleeping on beds. They asked us if our parents want to prove they have much money.\u201d", "0||Ukraine activist Kateryna Handzyuk dies from acid attackA Ukrainian anti-corruption activist has died from wounds caused by an acid attack, sparking local protests and concern from European officials over growing violence against civil society. Kateryna Handzyuk\u2019s investigations into police graft and political corruption in her native Kherson, a Black Sea port, had angered local officials. In late July, a man doused her with a litre of sulphuric acid when she left her house. Handzyuk suffered burns to more than 30% of her body. She continued to speak out against corruption from her hospital bed and called for a thorough investigation into her attackers. She had 11 operations before she finally succumbed to her injuries on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, called for the attackers to be punished. Five suspects have been arrested, including a former police officer believed to have led the assault. But it does not appear any of those arrested ordered the attack. Meanwhile, local anger has surged. Several hundred supporters of Handzyuk gathered by the interior ministry in downtown Kiev on Sunday evening to demand that police find the killers. Members of the European commission on Monday demanded a vigorous investigation into Handzyuk\u2019s death. \u201cAttacks against #civilsociety activists are unacceptable. The perpetrators of this vicious crime must be brought to justice,\u201d wrote Johannes Hahn, EU commissioner for European neighbourhood and enlargement negotiations, on Twitter. The attack on Handzyuk in July came on the same day as the death of another activist who had been shot. Vitaly Oleshko, a veteran of the conflict in south-east Ukraine, had also complained about government corruption in his native Berdyansk. He was shot in the back with a hunting rifle. Similar attacks have highlighted the pressure being put on civil organisations in Ukraine, where corrupt politicians and sharp-elbowed businessmen are suspected of curbing scrutiny with gangland methods. Handzyuk was a well-known activist who was also a member of Kherson\u2019s city council. In one of her investigations, she accused a local police official, Artem Antoschuk, of taking a 3% cut of all local business deals and government contracts. Speaking with Ukrainian broadcaster Hromadske from her hospital bed in late September, she said she believed the attack against her was an attempted assassination. \u201cWhy do I consider this an attempt to kill me?\u201d said Handzyuk. \u201cBecause they poured the acid on my head. If they wanted just to scare me, it would be on the arms, legs, face.\u201d Handzyuk added that she was still in deep pain from the acid, saying one had to \u201cbe patient\u201d. She called on the presidential administration to provide political pressure to investigate attacks against local activists. \u201cSo many attacks in such a short period of time have gone without punishment and with the connivance of the police,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we have to speak loudly about this at the Bankova [Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration].\u201d", "16||'Chunks of my tongue came off \u2013 you could see the tastebuds': Ross Edgley on swimming around Great BritainRoss Edgley, who has just become the first man to swim around Great Britain, is trying to describe what it feels like to have your tongue disintegrate. \u201cI realised something was bad when I woke up with chunks of it on my pillow,\u201d he recalls. The flesh was translucent, but otherwise a lot like beef stroganoff or slow-cooked pork. \u201cIt\u2019s that tender, you\u2019re just pulling strips off,\u201d says Edgley energetically. \u201cYou could see the tastebuds on it, it was that thick.\u201d Endurance swimmers call it salt mouth \u2013 the effect of seawater buildup in your mouth and throat. Edgley\u2019s was at its worst as he passed Dungeness in early June, about 85 hours of swimming after setting out from Margate harbour. \u201cEven a week in, it went from being a swim as most people consider it, as a sport, to being a survival exercise,\u201d he says. That \u201cexercise\u201d lasted 157 days, during each of which Edgley slept no more than six hours, and often less, and swam for six hours, and sometimes more. Alongside him was his support crew, husband and wife Matt and Suzanne Knight, on board their 16m (52ft) catamaran Hecate. The instant Edgley boarded the boat every day, its location was recorded, and it would return to that exact point when the time came for Edgley to return to the water, thereby ensuring a continuous circumnavigation of 1,792 miles \u2013 about the same distance as London to Moscow by road. In the course of his five-month-long Great British Swim, Edgley raced ferries, stopped boats, braved storms, swam with countless dolphins, suffered hundreds of jellyfish stings, saw \u201cevery single seal\u201d, and became a connoisseur of the nation\u2019s waters. \u201cScotland tasted really nice,\u201d he tells me. The Irish Sea, he says after consideration, was \u201corganic\u201d. The Humber Estuary: \u201cstraight-up fertiliser\u201d. Looking back, he had an overabundance of naivety, Edgley cheerily admits now, on the penultimate day of his journey. It is Saturday morning and we are drinking coffee in the cockpit of Hecate, moored off Margate pier ahead of his final leg. He shows me a 5kg bucket of petroleum jelly, nearly hollowed out. \u201cAt the start, I was like, there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to get through that. We\u2019ve done almost a kilo a month.\u201d Edgley himself is barely recognisable from the sleek bodybuilder of his first vlog. Then he had resembled a superhero who shared DNA with one of those giant river otters, or a pedigree bull terrier. The bearded man sitting opposite me, wearing a bobble hat and a fleece-lined hooded cloak, is more reminiscent of Bilbo Baggins towards the end of his unexpected journey. In five months, Edgley has put on 8kg to weigh 100kg, gaining muscle in his shoulders, losing it in his legs, and developing a \u201cseal-like bulk\u201d all over. \u201cMy body\u2019s completely changed. I\u2019ve got hairier, I\u2019ve got fatter.\u201d Fitness is a slippery concept, although he tried to pin it down in his \u201ceccentric and comprehensive\u201d bestseller, The World\u2019s Fittest Book. \u201cThere is no definition. Right now, I\u2019m really fit if you want me to swim around Great Britain, but awful if you want me to run a marathon.\u201d After swimming 12 hours a day for five months, he has adapted \u201cto the point where I\u2019m really going to be bad on land\u201d. He has been doing balance and leg-strengthening exercises in readiness. His feet have entirely lost their arches, he tells me, though their purply-yellow colour is apparently no cause for concern. His trench foot (\u201cpretty bad, at one point. Yeah, you can lose them\u201d) has cleared up, as has a \u201csea ulcer\u201d on his heel. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it sounds!\u201d he says, seeing my expression. \u201cIf you got a tiny cut, it would never heal, it would just get deeper and deeper. It would start going through to the bone, essentially.\u201d Edgley\u2019s achievement, it quickly becomes apparent, is compelling not just as an unprecedented feat of mental and physical endurance, but in a similar way to those lurid quasi-documentaries about medical anomalies. At the same time as his tongue was disintegrating, chafing from his wetsuit created a raw wound, inspiring the viewers of his weekly vlogs to give him the nickname Rhino Neck. Efforts to protect it with layers of Sudocrem, plasters, Vaseline, bin bags and duct tape were time-consuming and only partially successful. \u201cImagine having an open wound and rubbing it with sandpaper for 12 hours a day \u2013 that\u2019s what it was like,\u201d says Edgley. \u201cI woke up the next morning and my bedsheets were stuck to it. I was like, \u2018Oh, for God\u2019s sake\u2019, ripped it off, then got in and swam.\u201d His girlfriend, Hester Sabery, was fortunate enough to be visiting him onboard Hecate at the time. \u201cOh yeah, that was horrific,\u201d she says later, wincing at the memory. \u201cHe just had blisters all over his shoulders, his neck, his chest. And when he moved, they were all just there on the pillow.\u201d But he never thought of giving up, he says. He took to heart the advice of Alexei Janssen, a performance coach to the royal marines, to focus on the process \u2013 then the outcome would become inevitable. \u201cNever did I think about arriving at Margate, or quitting. I stopped counting up or down.\u201d There was no time to feel sorry for himself, anyway, with his precious few hours out of the water needing to be spent sleeping or eating. With a daily target of 15,000 calories, Edgley has described his endeavour as a \u201cgiant eating competition, with a bit of swimming in between\u201d. \u201cROSS EDGLEY\u2019S BANANA TALLY\u201d, crudely scrawled on the cockpit roof in permanent marker, stands at 649. While in the water he ate one every 20 minutes, with the occasional break for fortified porridge or noodles. Between swims he ate breakfast \u2013 a proper fry-up, with four slices of toast, two or three eggs, baked beans, the lot \u2013 lunch and dinner: a full day\u2019s meals every 12 hours. \u201cIt was like double time,\u201d says Suzanne Knight, who took charge of Edgley\u2019s nutrition. \u201cThe thing is, when he started the swim, he carried no fat at all, he was all muscle. That\u2019s why we went crazy and bulked him up so much.\u201d For Edgley, who co-founded a fitness supplements company, food needed to be dense not only in calories but also in nutrients; digestible in the mix of what else he had eaten that day; and palatable, given his current state of physical degradation. (\u201cCan you imagine your salt tongue hanging off, then trying to eat granola?\u201d) He took an intuitive approach to his diet, which allowed for emerging from the ocean to wolf down two Dominos pizzas, back to back. But the challenge was as much mental as physical. \u201cWhen you add it all up, I\u2019ve probably spent a month on my own, staring at the bottom of the seabed,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were times when I wasn\u2019t thinking about surviving, when I could coast \u2013 that\u2019s when you can go into this moving meditation and mull over everything. But people ask if I\u2019ve come to any amazing epiphanies, whereas I get out and go: \u2018Have we got any cheese left? Can I get a cheese toastie?\u2019\u201d In his cabin he was reading Marcus Aurelius\u2019s Meditations on stoic philosophy (\u201cIt\u2019s been brilliant, this psychology in the face of adversity\u201d), which he says dovetailed with sports science. Edgley knew that revving himself up, or swimming angry, could stress his immune system and jeopardise his endurance for the rest of the journey. His MO, as he explained in a vlog, was to \u201cswim with a smile\u201d, even through clouds of jellyfish. (Part of the reason he grew a beard was to serve as protection.) \u201cThat was easier said than done, and sometimes I was putting on a brave face \u2013 for the crew as well.\u201d His lowest moment, he says \u2013 worse than the salt tongue or his \u201cneck hanging off\u201d \u2013 was when he was kept awake for six hours by a sting to the face while crossing the Irish Sea. He mimes feverish scratching of his arms: \u201cI looked possessed. I was walking around naked on deck because the wind was the only thing that soothed my skin.\u201d It sounds like King Lear on the moor, I say, by now in my own heavy-weather robe. \u201cYeah, it was! Eventually, I went to bed and from my cabin, saw day turn to night and night turn to day. The tide changed, and Matt knew I hadn\u2019t slept. He said: \u2018Mate, I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 you have to go in.\u2019 It had literally just stopped itching.\u201d It seems paradoxical that someone so dedicated to fine-tuning the body \u201cas an instrument, not an ornament\u201d \u2013 a phrase by which he repeatedly condemns the aesthetics-led approach of the wider fitness industry \u2013 would cause himself so much physical damage. \u201cI think sports science \u2013 and medical science \u2013 quite rightly errs on the side of caution and would be like: \u2018You need rest, you need to take antibiotics, or something,\u2019\u201d Edgley agrees. But he sees his own body as not just an instrument but an experiment \u2013 a willing subject on which to test his theories of athletic performance \u201cin the lab that is the Great British coastline\u201d. He was inspired by the Hungarian-Canadian endocrinologist Hans Selye\u2019s work on general adaptation in 1936. By gradually increasing lab rats\u2019 tolerance to poison, Selye was able to prove that stress and stimuli were the key to adaptation, says Edgley. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, yes, I absolutely am worried about long-term damage. But what if I am becoming one of Hans Selye\u2019s indestructible rats? You don\u2019t know. \u201cIn the fitness community, we\u2019re all told \u2018Lose a stone in the week\u2019, \u2018Get fit in five easy steps\u2019 \u2013 no one wants to say, \u2018Get fit through stress and stimuli according to Hans Selye\u2019s work in 1936.\u2019 That\u2019s not going to sell anything. No one wants to say: \u2018If you want to get fit or lose weight, it\u2019s going to be hard \u2013 you\u2019re going to suffer.\u2019\u201d Is he a masochist? \u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d Five months ago, he would have said no; now, he is not so sure. \u201cIn this small bubble, with Matt and I both so driven towards the same goal, I\u2019m like: \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t you swim with your tongue hanging off?\u2019 I would say I\u2019m not a masochist, but maybe a month from now, when I\u2019m looking back objectively, from outside the bubble, I\u2019ll go: \u2018What was I doing?\u2019\u201d So what will he be doing a month from now? \u201cWell, genuinely learning to walk again\u201d \u2013 and then a marathon by Christmas. \u201cI think that might be quite a good litmus test.\u201d Red Bull Media House documented the Great British Swim in weekly vlogs via the Red Bull YouTube channel.

It looks like a miniature Washington Monument on the first landing of the 10th district federal courthouse. Closer inspection reveals it represents a border crossing marker, half white Italian marble and half Mexican honey onyx, the union of two places where cultures flow as one not far from the Rio Grande. Up above on the fourth floor in the Guadalupe courtroom the cultures are torn asunder along with consciences as all rise at 9am sharp on Tuesday for US district court judge Robert Brack entering through a back door to his bench. Facing him below along the benchrail are 13 unlucky men, ages 20 to 30, in shackles and chains and wearing jail suits of different colors from the counties that rent space to the federal marshal. They wear ear buds for the translation. They are looking down, expressionless. They have been caught for a second time trying to enter the United States. Time was when you could try to enter 40 times and the border guards would turn you around and send you back. Not now. These young men, all fathers feeding their families, have been criminalized. Defendant Ramirez, please step to the podium. His public defender tells the story: He is 25. He is from Honduras, racked by gang and political violence. He has a wife and seven-year-old stuck in New Jersey applying for asylum. He had worked before on a cattle ranch north of the border but got deported. He came back with his family. He was charged with criminal re-entry while his wife and child remain in asylum limbo. \u201cThis is an unbearable sorrow,\u201d Brack told Ramirez. \u201cWe have had enough separation of families.\u201d That gnaws at the 65-year-old judge, who took senior status in July after hearing some 15,000 stories like those of poor Ramirez over the past 15 years. \u201cSome days,\u201d he says in chambers, \u201cit can just stoop you over.\u201d On those days, he would sit down and write a letter. First to former president Barack Obama, in 2010 as the Tea Party coalesced around anti-immigrant screeds: Yesterday morning, I presided over the case of US v Jesus Chavez-Quezada. Mr Chavez, a citizen of Mexico, is 21 years old. All of his family, parents and siblings live in the United States. He was educated in a local high school, he has absolutely no criminal history and he has been employed consistently. Additionally, he has a five-year-old son. Charged with the crime of felony re-entry, Mr. Chavez wept as he was sentenced to time-served and was deported \u2018back to Mexico\u2019, a country he has never known as his home. He has no money, no family there, no prospect of employment, and at the moment is likely standing on a street corner in Juarez, the most dangerous city in the world, terrified and uncertain which way to turn. Every day I preside over such cases, over an immigration system that you have described as broken. Every day, many times each day, I see the terribly tragic, real-world consequences of the failure to repair that system. Every day, innocent lives are turned upside down and families are torn apart. As I sentenced Mr Chavez, something in me snapped, as I considered how differently things might have turned out for him had the Dream Act passed. Surely, we, as a nation, are better than this. Many say that all who come without permission are criminals and ought to be punished as such. Many say that most who come bring drugs or are otherwise associated with the drug trade. Many say that a path to citizenship rewards criminal behavior. Given my belief that none of these things are true, to all of the many I would say: \u2018Look more closely. See what I see, hear what I hear.\u2019 Be wary of the angriest voices. My prayer is that even in this difficult political climate, you reignite the push for comprehensive immigration reform and that you insist that the debate be driven by facts and not angry rhetoric. If I can be of service in informing the ongoing debate, please let me know. God bless you as you continue to serve our great nation. He sent copies to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, house speaker, John Boehner, Senate judiciary chairman, Pat Leahy, and homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano. The judge awaits a response. As he does to six similar letters to Obama and other federal officials through 2013. He gave up writing. The judge doesn\u2019t have a clue what happened to Jesus Chavez. Jesus shuffled out the courtroom in leg chains through a black door that locked itself, in the custody of the marshal, down the hall to El Paso and into a mist of memory. Just like Ramirez. They would pack him on an airplane to Mexico City where he is bound for an uncertain fate. The planes fly out three days a week and fill fast. \u201cVaya con Dios,\u201d Brack tells him. Brack is a product of the borderlands and embraces it. He was reared in Clovis, a town of 40,000 with dairy barns clustered around manned by Latino labor. He worked the fields with Latinos, and nobody thought about papers. The border was secured only by those 260 markers from Las Cruces to San Diego, some decorated with plastic flowers for those lost to the journey. The folks would go from Ju\u00e1rez to El Paso, Texas, and work the cattle or the chilli fields around Las Cruces until the work was done. Then they went home. It was like that for centuries, depending on economic needs. The border, after all, is a nebulous concept in the minds of many who live along it. It is especially so when you stand at the site of the Gadsden Purchase in Mesilla, now part of Las Cruces metro, where in 1854 the Mexicans took a check at the end of the barrel of a US gun to give up nearly 30,000 sq miles of territory. \u201cOur people were here before the United States,\u201d says retired Catholic Bishop Ricardo Ramirez, an advocate for poor immigrants in New Mexico and Texas. \u201cNow they are locked up in chains. There is a violence associated with this. It is a crisis of conscience. It is a violation of humanity and decency.\u201d Brack and Ramirez are close friends. Brack is a devout Catholic, the son of a railroad man. Growing up, his best friend was Jimmie Reyna, whose mother urged the boys in Spanish to do what they would with enthusiasm. They went to law school together at the University of New Mexico. Reyna became a judge on the federal court in Washington DC. Our Lady of Guadalupe, the revolutionary mestiza mother of the Divine, is everywhere in the new court building: from the courthouse to the restaurant door, images of her in the photos of the indigenous on another court floor, and tattooed on the backs of countless defendants who process before the judge in the courtroom by her name. She is their protector, Ramirez says, when nobody else wants them. \u201cI like to think I\u2019m mitigating the misery,\u201d Brack says. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I would have quit long ago.\u201d Up next to the podium: Defendant Lopez. He is from Guatemala by way of the Mexican state of Chiapas. He fled the violence of his homeland. He fears death if he returns. His wife is in Florida with a six-month-old child. Three other children are in Chiapas, the site of a peasant revolt when the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) killed their corn market. His wife and baby have political asylum but because he was caught twice entering, he is a criminal. He lived in El Norte for five years until he was first shipped out in 2011. \u201cThis nasty immigration business, I hate this,\u201d Brack told Lopez. \u201cI hate this is happening to you.\u201d He sentenced him to 48 days time served in the county jail, and ordered that he be allowed to apply for asylum in El Paso. Advocates say he has about a 3% chance of scoring. \u201cVaya con Dios,\u201d the judge says. He says it is hard almost every time he utters it. Because, he insists, this is a crisis of our own making. During the first world war, we wanted Latino labor. During the Great Depression, the heat came down first on the blacks and brown people, Ramirez says. But then they were welcome again during and after the second world war in the Bracero program that virtually allowed unlimited access until the 1980s. There was a stab at immigration reform in 1986, and that is when amnesty became a dirty word. Still, immigrants were recruited by food processors and cattle feeders up the old Great Western Cattle Trail from El Paso to Dodge City. But something changed. Brack asked a defendant if he had any problems in 2006 getting in. \u201cNo,\u201d was his answer. \u201cYou certainly know there\u2019s a hard feeling about immigrants right now,\u201d he told all the defendants. \u201cWe\u2019re caught up in this change of attitude. There is nothing but heartache ahead if you come back.\u201d In fact, there is up to a year in prison if any one of them tries. \u201cEveryone gets caught, and everyone gets charged with a crime,\u201d he told the courtroom. \u201cOur border is guarded jealously.\u201d Brack traces it to 9/11. The nation was on lockdown and in fear. Fear looks for a group of people to dehumanize, says public defender Peter Edwards, who has been working this court alongside Brack for two decades. \u201cIt is my job to make them human before the court,\u201d said Edwards, whose Jewish parents from England fled for the United States following the second world war. He sees parallels from his parents\u2019 immigration story that few want to consider. There was the Tea Party revolution in 2010 with boisterous calls for a wall along the border \u2013 which border patrol never asked for. And then came Donald Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, with a zero-tolerance policy. In 2003, there were 150,000 border encounters in the 10th judicial district. About 4,500 were prosecuted. The rest were simply turned around to try again another day. In 2017, there were 10,000 encounters at the border and 100% were arrested and charged. Brack had the heaviest caseload of any federal judge in the nation. He was happy to welcome a second judge, Kenneth Gonzales, five years ago. And over all those cases, Brack never saw a defendant who looked like a terrorist or someone who would endanger our way of life. Almost all are just looking for a wage. And, in not one of those 15,000 criminal case hearings has an employer stood before him charged with illegally hiring immigrants. They pay taxes and vote and influence politicians. More typical is a young man from Oaxaca awhile back. He was in detention for 27 days. He told the judge they were among the best of his life because he was able to think for the first time. In Mexico, if he found work that day he had no time to think. If he did not find work the next day, he could only think about finding work. \u201cThinking is a luxury I\u2019ve never had,\u201d he told the judge. He concluded that home is good with his wife and children. He came here only for the promise of higher wages. \u201cBut it was all a grand deception,\u201d he told Brack. \u201cThere is nothing here for me.\u201d Brack tells the defendants that he admires them, that he would do the same thing, that they are on a \u201cnoble quest to feed your families\u201d. But he urges them not to return because everything has changed and they fall victim to our debate. \u201cI want them to get back on their quest.\u201d He wants policymakers to see what he sees. That we are changing the rules all the time. On that Tuesday afternoon he intended to follow up on the status of some separated children held in Yonkers, New York. He had recently ordered that the father should be held off a deportation flight until they were reunited. Such are his days, even at half-time. It\u2019s all because immigration has become the third rail of politics, he muses. Nobody can do anything because of fear at the ballot box, so the fear is stoked. And that way nothing gets fixed. The supply of labor is attacked but never the demand. \u201cWe were telling them all this time that we don\u2019t take this too seriously,\u201d Brack said. He still hopes that hearts can be turned. Make the undocumented meatpacker a citizen. Pay a fine and time served. Build a wall, if you will. He pleads for some justice. \u201cIs this justice? Is this fair?\u201d he asks as he stares out the window to the blue hills of Mexico. Art Cullen is editor of the Storm Lake Times in Iowa and won the 2017 Pulitzer prize for editorial writing.

The movie, Journey\u2019s End, is being shown for free in churches and places of worship across England, with a collection at each screening being held for Combat Stress, a charity that focuses on the psychological impact of war. Journey\u2019s End, released earlier this year, is adapted from RC Sherriff\u2019s play, which starred a young Laurence Olivier when it was first staged in 1928. The story is set in the trenches of northern France in 1918. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not about the glorification of war, it\u2019s about the insanity of war,\u201d said Guy de Beaujeu, the film\u2019s producer. He had the idea of church screenings after Private Peaceful, another first world war movie he produced in 2012, was shown in his local church. \u201cIt was an emotional and special experience to watch the film surrounded by memorials of those who had died in the first world war and other wars. It felt incredibly apposite.\u201d Among the churches taking part in the charity screenings is St Paul\u2019s Howell Hill, in Cheam, Surrey, which has already allocated more than 400 tickets. The Rev Martin Wainwright said people in his congregation had relatives who had fought in the first world war. \u201cOne woman\u2019s father was awarded an MC [Military Cross] and went on to fight in the second world war. Another showed me his great uncle\u2019s last letter home before being killed. It\u2019s still very close.\u201d Wainwright said Journey\u2019s End was \u201cone of those movies you need to watch but don\u2019t necessarily want to watch. It\u2019s about the reality and the cost of war.\u201d Combat Stress worked with the movie\u2019s cast on depicting the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder on troops. The film showed the experiences of the trenches in \u201can unflinching and truthful way\u201d, said its CEO Sue Freeth. \u201cThere is no glorification of war here.\u201d Most churches in the UK have memorials and rolls of honour recording the names of people who died in war. The Church of England has provided parishes with the format for a vigil service to be held to mark the centenary of the armistice, with prayers for peace and remembrance. Churches were \u201cplaces for the community\u201d and the C of E was delighted to support the screening of Journey\u2019s End to highlight the mental health aspect of trench warfare and to raise money for Combat Stress, said Ben Hollebon of the C of E.", "8||May will threaten a no-deal Brexit. MPs must call her bluffSince the summer, Downing Street\u2019s political strategy has been clear. It has systematically talked up the prospect of no deal in the hope that any deal will be judged a success in comparison. That\u2019s why the government has published a steady flow of technical papers on Britain\u2019s preparedness: from chartering ships to bring in food supplies to stockpiling medicines to advising businesses to simply leave the country. The anxiety levels of parliamentarians and the public has understandably risen. Perhaps that was the point all along. Yet no deal has always been the least likely outcome. Setting aside the consequences for the UK, a no-deal Brexit would mean that pan-European overnight bank clearing could not take place, causing the global financial system to crash for the second time in a decade. With 48% of European aviation insured through London, half the continent\u2019s planes would be grounded. Nearly 80% of Europe\u2019s capital markets are in London and might be inaccessible. In the 21st century, no British prime minister is going to let one of the world\u2019s most advanced nations struggle for food and medicine. And even if Theresa May were prepared to follow through on her threat, parliament \u2013 where perhaps 600 of 650 members oppose no deal \u2013 would never allow her to do so. So no deal is simply a hoax, an act of political deception. So far, it\u2019s working. The right response from remainers would have been to call out the government and focus on the quality of the deal rather than the plausibility of achieving one. Leavers made big promises in the referendum, and it is right that they should be held accountable. And yet rather than offering sober analysis, many remainers appear drawn to the doomsday scenario, as if confirming their worst suspicions is what matters most. So they have become accidental collaborators, amplifying precisely the message the government wished to get through. The endless speculation about a potentially disastrous outcome has occluded serious assessment of what is desirable. Virtually all economists agree that no matter what deal is struck, leaving the EU will damage the UK economy. While the sky will not fall in, different arrangements have very different economic impacts. It is therefore the responsibility of every parliamentarian to make the best assessment of whether the government\u2019s eventual proposal is in our national interest or not \u2013 whether it protects or advances our interests, not merely whether it averts disaster. The government is set to ask parliament and the country to take a leap in the dark and vote for a \u201cblank Brexit\u201d. Britain and the EU will have a legally binding agreement for the withdrawal and transition, but a political declaration for the future partnership. Crucially, the political declaration will have no legal force. Brexit protagonists will have everything to play for from April next year. The cliff edge so feared by business will have been postponed for 21 months, but not eliminated. The prime minister may declare \u201cprosperity in our time\u201d but as Neville Chamberlain found at Munich, a political declaration is little more than a scrap of paper. The UK will have traded its most significant negotiating card \u2013 the financial settlement of nearly \u00a340bn \u2013 for the standstill transition. Forget \u00a3350m a week for the NHS, it will mean the transition has been bought for \u00a32bn a month. We will have lost the ability to change our minds and withdraw article 50 notification. And by insisting on a time-limited transition \u2013 rather than a formulation such as \u201cas short as possible, as long as necessary\u201d \u2013 we will not be able to play for time. Moreover, the single market is much more important to us than the UK market is to any of the 27 remaining member states. While the single market accounts for nearly 50% of total UK trade in goods and services, the UK accounts for less than 8% of total trade for most individual EU states. If Britain leaves the EU on this basis, we will be left extraordinarily exposed, reliant on the kindness of strangers to secure a good deal. This leap in the dark is a huge gamble for the country to take. It is precisely this asymmetry in negotiating leverage that will mean European leaders will join the government in calling on MPs to vote for its proposal. They have every incentive to send the UK into purgatory and so will claim the alternative is no deal. With such a chaotic and divided approach to negotiations from the UK, it should be little surprise that the EU will recommend that British parliamentarians pass the vote. It will reflect the fact that they have negotiated far more successfully, securing their interests rather than ours. Despite these clear disadvantages, do not be surprised if the business lobby gears up to support the government\u2019s plan. The extremism of the Brexit ultras has played into the government\u2019s hands and much of the business community now seriously believes that swathes of the Conservative party would positively welcome the UK crashing out of the EU. But politicians from all parties need to hold their nerve. It is their duty to critically examine the government\u2019s proposal to determine whether it is in Britain\u2019s long-term national interest. Neither the British public nor history will reflect kindly on those who sacrificed the right deal for any deal. MPs representing leave-supporting constituencies may fear the electoral consequences of voting against the government\u2019s plan, and vice versa, yet with the next general election likely to be in 2022, voters will be less interested in how their representatives choose to vote now than whether they have a good job and rising living standards in years to come. If there is a good outcome, and the economy does reasonably, then the government will get the credit. If there is a bad outcome, and the economy suffers, voters will hold both those who promoted Brexit, and those who enabled it, to account. \u2022 Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and founder of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice.

It is time to seek comfort in warming, hearty one-pots \u2013 and, in particular, the restorative power of chicken soup. The jury is very much out on whether the subject of this month\u2019s How to Eat (HTE) might \u201cdo stuff\u201d to you medicinally \u2013 the so-called Jewish penicillin likely exerts a strong placebo effect \u2013 but as we shiver through chilly commutes, hacking and coughing our way towards Christmas, arriving home to a steaming bowl of chicken soup indisputably lifts the soul. That bone broth warms the marrow. But only if it is done properly, which is where HTE \u2013 the series examining how best to eat Britain\u2019s favourite dishes \u2013 comes in. So what is the ultimate expression of chicken soup? First, an apology For sanity\u2019s sake, this piece will limit itself to chicken soup prepared in a broadly European and North American style. Not out of chauvinism, much less xenophobia. But simply because exploring the full panoply of Asian, African and Latin American chicken soups in a way that does them justice would make this article balloon into an unmanageable, indigestible sprawl. An epic so vast it would make War and Peace (that \u201cloose, baggy monster\u201d, as Henry James put it) look like an offhand tweet. Defining chicken soup Bits. It should have bits in it. This broth should be dense, with visible pieces of chicken, vegetables, pulses and pasta. You may not be able to stand your spoon in it, but your spoon should definitely encounter some firm resistance. That heft, that ruggedness is central to this soup\u2019s ability to banish the blues \u2013 both in the solidity and safety it suggests, and in the textural and flavour variation it provides in each mouthful. You need to chew here. Think of it as rewarding work. Eating chicken soup should feel like you are taking on a hot, generously filling fuel, laying down essential fat and protein for the cruel winter ahead (hence a gelatinous bone-broth base, speckled with globules of fat, is preferable). Chicken soup should never be smooth. Cream of chicken soup, that pallid, sweet concoction \u2013 that looks more like a milkshake and in which the chicken meat has invariably gone AWOL \u2013 is utterly childish. It may sound more sophisticated, but chicken soup given the velout\u00e9 treatment is similarly vapid. A velout\u00e9 might be a smart way to showcase a single vegetable (say, Jerusalem artichoke), but its silky mouthfeel is jarring in a context where you want body, chunks, meat. Similarly, there is something eerie about clear chicken consomm\u00e9s. That is an awful lot of cheffy work for a soup that will leave any right-thinking diner asking: where\u2019s the rest of it? It is as if someone has stolen, if not chicken soup\u2019s soul, then its crown jewels. Method of delivery Soup served in a cup will always, as Danny Dyer might put it, leave you feeling mugged off. The idea that all soups should be blended into a smoothly drinkable texture is infantile, and there is something about hurriedly slurping down gulps of warm, viscous savoury liquid (in contrast to the way a spoon moderates the pace of consumption) that is actively nauseating. Ideally, chicken soup should be served in a wide, deep bowl and consumed with a round soup spoon (using an oval dessert spoon, on the basis that it is more elegant, is a real Hyacinth Bucket move). Such a bowl retains its heat, acts as a reassuring visual representation of how thoroughly your hunger will be sated and gives you plenty of space to root around. According to this historic \u2013 and hopefully satirical \u2013 piece from the Guardian from way back in [blows dust off file] 2002, etiquette dictates that you should only ever fill your spoon to 75% of its capacity, sip only from its sides and never bang it against the bowl. It is a set of rules that threatens to suck all the joy from what should be the most informal of dishes. This is chicken soup. It is proper tie-off, elbows-on-the-table, dig-in troughing. No airs. No graces. Get stuck in. Likewise, there is no practical reason to tilt the bowl away from you as you finish the last dregs of your soup, other than as some coded middle-class signalling to people around the table that you too unthinkingly adhere to petty bourgeois niceties. It is awkward nonsense. Ignore it. Components Apart from the chicken, which is firm enough that it can overhang the edges slightly, everything should be chopped into small enough pieces that a few of them can comfortably nestle together in each spoonful. Including long, floppy strands of difficult to control ingredients (spaghetti, flat noodles, cabbage etc) will likely leave you wearing half of your soup. In a noodle soup, you sign up for that; it is a different proposition. But in chicken soup, keep it tidy. For instance, use smaller pastina (orzo, anelli, sorprese). Good things to put in chicken soup Real pieces of chicken This may sound obvious, but it is a suggestion widely ignored by many commercial manufacturers of canned and fresh soups. Get some darker meat in there for additional flavour and do not shred the chicken. In a soup, shredded chicken becomes waterlogged and woolly. Instead, cut it into firmer chunks. Vegetables Onion, sweetcorn, celery, carrot, cabbage (darker, challenging varieties, for example, kale), celeriac, parsnip. Feel free to char or part-roast some of those vegetables first to build in further layers of flavour. Chorizo Used sparingly as a seasoning (this is not chicken and ham soup), a small amount goes a long way. Bulking agents A scattering of chickpeas, rice, red/yellow lentils, pasta or barley (perhaps even a mix of several of these) will add textural variety, a satisfying bottom-end weight and further nutty, iron-y flavours. Cream Just a drop or two, swirled through. Bad things to put in chicken soup Turkey The most disappointing meat on the market: accept no imitations. Bacon Unless safely marooned on a central island of ingredients, above the waterline and used strictly as a garnish, bacon becomes curiously mealy in soups. Likewise, chicken crackling: if immersed in all that liquid, it ends up not crisp and salty, but unedifyingly soggy and slimy. Mushrooms In a chicken pie, all good, but in a hot soup, the flavour of mushrooms is muffled and, like leeks, they achieve an altogether unpleasant level of slipperiness. Needless to say, even before we get to the issue of including prunes in a savoury soup (ye gods!), HTE is not a fan of cock-a-leekie. Potato In a soup, chunks of potato are always either undercooked or mush. There is no in between. Moreover, in a soup in which you need to work hard to avoid blandness (see flavour boosters, below), potato is a noncommittal shrug of an ingredient that adds body without flavour. Broccoli Water gets trapped in the heads of the florets and superheats so that, even as the soup cools, those pieces of broccoli maintain a thermonuclear temperature that could strip fire-resistant paint from a garage door, never mind the roof of your mouth. Not that you are likely to use them here, but as a general warning, tomatoes pose a similar danger. Peas Pointless, in this context. Egg Which came first: chicken soup or the idea of gently cooking strands of egg through it? HTE cannot say, but it is an ineffectual and unnecessary addition. Flavour boosters It is rare that HTE strays into the realms of seasoning specifics. The how-to-cook nitty gritty is Felicity Cloake\u2019s domain. But is worth reiterating that from salt, pepper, garlic and white wine upwards, chicken soup benefits enormously from some added va va voom to lift its somewhat beige ingredients. The more obvious herbs (parsley, thyme, bayleaf) can be too domineering, but if judged correctly, a little heat (ginger, chilli) can bring everything into sharper focus. Masala spices, harissa or ras el hanout can also be effectively deployed, but that is to take chicken soup on its travels in a way that HTE promised to avoid at the top of this piece. Bread and butter Even when stuffed to the gills, wiping your bowl clean with a piece of thickly buttered bread is the pinnacle of the chicken soup experience. Mopping up every last drop of those magical savoury juices is a must \u2013 like an impromptu roast chicken sandwich at the end of your meal. Who could say no to that? When Remarkably, many people swear by chicken soup as a hangover cure. In a fragile state, and certainly before midday, HTE could think of nothing worse. Even the thought of it makes HTE bilious. Chicken soup is even wasted at lunch, arguably. It is best eaten after dark, in deepest winter, when rain is lashing against the windows and, if only for a few hours, you are determined to hibernate from the world and its endless horrors. Self-care starts with chicken soup. So, chicken soup: how do you eat yours?", "0||Irish celebrities urge PM to protect citizens' rights in Northern IrelandMore than 1,000 Irish academics, film-makers, lawyers, writers, athletes, business owners and others have signed an open letter to the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, asking him to protect the rights of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland. The letter, published in Monday\u2019s Irish News newspaper, urges the Irish prime minister to address their \u201cgrave concern\u201d that Brexit and Northern Ireland\u2019s political deadlock will deny and erode nationalists\u2019 rights on issues such as the Irish language, marriage equality and healthcare. The region\u2019s power-sharing executive at Stormont imploded in January 2017, depriving it of a fully functioning elected government during negotiations about the impact on the Irish border of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. The direct appeal to the government in Dublin reflects anxiety that the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s (DUP) influence over Theresa May\u2019s Conservative minority government in London, combined with Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s abstention from Westminster, has left nationalists politically vulnerable and voiceless as Brexit talks reach their climax. \u201cThe political institutions remain in suspension as political unionism continues to deny respect for our Irish identity and language, marriage equality, access to justice for legacy matters,\u201d says the letter, in English and Gaelic. \u201cAs you know, these rights are now taken for granted by citizens in other parts of these islands. The British Conservative government has rendered itself unable to effect any progress on these rights issues due to its dependence on the DUP. Brexit threatens to deepen the rights crisis and there is a real danger of serious erosion of current guarantees.\u201d Niall Murphy, a prominent Belfast solicitor, helped to organise the letter. Signatories include the film director Jim Sheridan, the actor Adrian Dunbar, the footballer James McClean and trade union leaders. The letter reminded Varadkar of a commitment he gave in December 2017 to protect the interests and rights of northern nationalists as Irish and EU citizens. \u201cThere will be no hard border on our island. You will never again be left behind by an Irish government,\u201d the taoiseach said then, partly in response to an earlier open letter signed by 200 people. In an interview at the weekend, Varadkar said Brexit had undermined the 1998 Good Friday agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland and had frayed relations between Britain and Ireland. In the 2016 EU referendum, 56% of voters in Northern Ireland opted for remaining in the EU. However, most DUP voters back their party\u2019s support for withdrawal, which will remove one of the pillars of the Good Friday agreement. The Dublin government has to tried to walk a tightrope of reassuring northern nationalists without riling unionists. The DUP and senior loyalist paramilitaries have accused Dublin of \u201cBrit-bashing\u201d and using the spectre of IRA violence as a bargaining tool.", "10||Culture secretary says he subscribes to no UK papers or magazinesThe culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, who is responsible for overseeing the British media industry, has told an audience of newspaper editors that he doesn\u2019t subscribe to any British newspapers or magazines. He said he \u201cgenerally reads a summary of newspapers and certain comment pieces\u201d and had a subscription to Time magazine, while getting his news by listening to BBC Radio 4 and watching BBC TV news. He said he also enjoyed certain columnists in the Times. Asked five times to name a female columnist he enjoyed reading, he named the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Allison Pearson. Wright, a former lawyer who is also responsible for digital industries and regulating social media, has faced questions about his understanding of the media industry. He did not have a Twitter account before taking up his new job in the summer. In an appearance at the annual Society of Editors conference in Salford, he said quality British journalism was \u201cnot sufficiently rewarded\u201d but any proposals on a new government-supported funding model would have to wait for the conclusion of the Cairncross review of the British newspaper industry. \u201cI\u2019m confident that the review will show that there are ways for quality journalism to go from strength to strength,\u201d he said, suggesting there could be a particular provision for the funding of struggling local newspapers. \u201cOur press has a level of trust and freedom that is rightly envied across the world, but a free and trusted press must also be a sustainable press,\u201d he said. Wright said the \u201ctransfer of trust from generation to generation can no longer be taken for granted\u201d and news outlets needed to invest in investigative journalism and authoritative reporting of politics. \u201cWe need to persuade the public of the value of this kind of journalism to help the public to rediscover the difference between the things you see online that just aren\u2019t true and good quality journalism.\u201d He also said newsrooms must diversify the social and geographic background of their employees in order to remain relevant and attract readers: \u201cAsk probing questions about the make-up of your own organisations, not simply because it\u2019s the right thing to do but because it makes good business sense.\u201d He spoke out against politicians using parliamentary privilege to break court injunctions, such as when Peter Hain identified the Topshop boss Sir Philip Green as the subject of a series of articles in the Daily Telegraph. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter for Peter Hain but as a former attorney general it is very important to respect what the court has decided,\u201d said Wright. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it if I had been in his position but I\u2019m not going to criticise him for what he did. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s sensible of us to push the limits of parliamentary privilege too far.\u201d", "5||How Coach Trip picked up teens and ran out of gasSimply put, Coach Trip was Come Dine With Me in confined spaces. This extreme proximity meant that airs and graces could not be maintained past day three: sooner or later, everything came out. The pair dynamics made it: the idea of watching two people testing their internal dynamic to the limits while also integrating into an external one was the thrill. Big Brother had got it wrong; it was pre-existing intimate relationships \u2013 how couples, friends, develop their own internal language \u2013 that was the real fascination. Add to that it was a classic of the class tourism genre. Pensioners from Dorset having to bus about abroad with hideous, posh, pink-cheeked Libertines fans in pork-pie hats. Carnivores from Barnsley getting up the nose of snobby Clapham vegans. Couples who woke up to the fact that one of them was wildly unpopular was always a particularly tart realisation. As was the middle-aged behaving spitefully or childishly towards the young \u2013 so unseemly you almost never see it in real life. The torture of being put back on the bus with the same people who\u2019d just voted you a yellow card, ie one step from eviction, is expressly forbidden in the Geneva Convention. Channel 4 didn\u2019t give a hoot. Coach Trip lasted a generous 12 seasons and a celebrity version but, just like Come Dine With Me, there was no obvious reason why it should ever run out of steam, unless humanity suddenly lost its capacity to sneer at spoilt teens and boorish welders. Then the yoofs came for it. The show was traded out to E4, and where once there had been Britain\u2019s rich tapestry, now there were a series of airbag trapezoids and slippery deltoids. Now, we have Coach Trip: Road to Ibiza. Then Road to Marbs. Then Road to Tenerife. Amber, Matt, Danny, Sam, Jordan, Chloe, Aaron, Abi: these are all the names that the characters would be getting from here on in. Rather than pack them off to cathedrals and art museums \u2013 which would have been funny \u2013 the dimwits are normally sent on a series of adventure-sports challenges. Parasailing. Hovercrafting. Mechanical bull riding. Each underlined with euphoric drum\u2019n\u2019bass, or that loungey house that E4 buys by the yard. Oh my days, it\u2019s like, well good. Meanwhile, the only stable character, Brendan, suffers from Flandersisation. Once a coach driver who happens-to-be-gay, in the Ibiza era he is a camp siren blaring. Every time he sees a cylindrical object he has to think of a synonym for John Thomas. Every time he sees a bag of mincemeat he has to do at least 12 minutes of repartee about mincing with one of the mince-brains. For one activity, there\u2019s a caricature competition. One strapping knucklehead, told to draw a caricature, draws his female subject topless. Poor Brendan is now reduced to the role of primary school teacher confiscating the jizzing-cock pictures from his lowest-set pupils. He has lived too long. You can see him wishing for his very own red card. Perhaps setting a challenge of alpine brake-tampering would have been a greater act of mercy.", "24||Don DeLillo on Trump's America: 'I'm not sure the country is recoverable'Whenever he\u2019s able to separate himself from the distractions of daily life, from family obligations and the rolling thunder of 24-hour news, Don DeLillo taps out a few pages of his latest book. He writes out of habit and because he\u2019s in the grip of an idea that won\u2019t let him rest. He\u2019s constructing a story set around the next corner, in an America he may not live to see. Obliquely, unavoidably, he\u2019s writing about Donald Trump. Or as he puts it: \u201cI\u2019m working on a piece of fiction set three years in the future. But I\u2019m not trying to imagine the future in the usual terms. I\u2019m trying to imagine what has been torn apart and what can be put back together, and I don\u2019t know the answer. I hope I can arrive at an answer through writing the fiction.\u201d If DeLillo can\u2019t provide an answer, chances are no one can. The novelist has spent 50 years at the cutting edge of US culture. He\u2019s diagnosed America\u2019s tensions, explained its outbreaks of madness, in darkly comic profundity. Now nearing his 82nd birthday, his career has become more about the past than the future. Sometimes, this past takes the shape of old lines from Underworld or White Noise, read back to him as evidence of his prophetic gifts. At other times, it comes in a more tangible form. Love-Lies-Bleeding is a play he wrote back in 2005 that is being revived on the London stage. It\u2019s about Alex, a landscape artist paralysed by a stroke, and the ersatz squabbling family (son, ex-wife, new wife) who gather at the feeding tube to decide his fate. The play\u2019s mood is contemplative but the dialogue is bright, barbed and studded with absurdist one-liners. Speaking on the phone from New York, DeLillo says he can barely remember writing the thing. But he accepts that Love-Lies-Bleeding\u2019s themes \u2013 the end of a life, the technological twilight \u2013 bear some similarities with his last published novel, 2016\u2019s Zero K. \u201cI did think that Zero K was the culmination of a certain line of inquiry,\u201d he says. \u201cSo maybe this play was the start of all that.\u201d DeLillo has written several plays: Valparaiso was a spry deconstruction of celebrity culture; The Day Room a metaphysical comedy set inside a psychiatric institution. He likes the discipline involved in using a different set of tools, and the sense of release when the script meets the world. \u201cWhen I\u2019m working on a novel,\u201d he says, \u201cI tend to glide from one sentence to the next. The sentences help me reveal the character. In theatre, it\u2019s more complicated, because I don\u2019t know who the actors are. But that\u2019s all part of a play\u2019s evolution.\u201d He makes the process sound like passing on a baton. \u201cBefore anyone takes the stage, the play belongs to the playwright. In the rehearsal period, it\u2019s the director\u2019s play. But then, during the performance, it belongs to the actors.\u201d Inevitably, the journey can throw up surprises. \u201cWhen Valparaiso was staged,\u201d he says, laughing, \u201cI kept going to see it. But on about the 10th performance, one of the actors suddenly decided to say the lines in a thick French accent. It was kind of funny. I mean, if you mess around with my sentences in a novel, you\u2019re going to get in trouble. Whereas with a play, you have to hand it over. It finally becomes more theirs than mine.\u201d No doubt he\u2019s in good hands with Nottingham-based Jack McNamara, who has directed two other DeLillo plays. McNamara tells me he has adored the author for years and claims he can always recognise a DeLillo sentence. \u201cHe sets the bar very high, in that his work is totally strange and completely everyday. Profound and screamingly funny at the exact same time. Whenever I read another so-called great American writer, the beauty of the sentence is not quite there. The humour is not as sharp, the profundity not as deep.\u201d Like many, McNamara first fell for DeLillo when he read the 1985 novel White Noise, that dazzling deadpan satire of toxic academia. But in recent years, he feels the author\u2019s tone has shifted. \u201cHis novels are still steeped in the buzz of urban life, but there\u2019s more awareness of desolate, spare space, and more questions about what comes next. How do we approach death? How do we try to control it? It\u2019s as though his work is moving towards a final terrain.\u201d The evidence on the page would bear this out. Having cut his teeth as a Fifth Avenue ad man, DeLillo applied his copywriting skills to the nation as a whole. He was America\u2019s weathervane, its Geiger counter, mapping the landscape in pin-sharp prose. In Libra, he tackled the Kennedy assassination, the conflation of celebrity and terrorism in Mao II, and the deflating dotcom bubble in Cosmopolis. Since the doorstop bestseller Underworld, in 1998, his books have turned shorter, quieter, more teasingly inconclusive. The older he grows, the less narrative sense the world makes. Trump sits in the White House, there are pipe bombs in the post and Russian trolls are targeting the swing states. We may have reached the point when the facts outstrip the fictions. \u201cOh, I think whatever\u2019s going on now seems unique,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is whether the situation is terminal. I\u2019m very reluctant to talk about Trump, simply because everybody else is. We\u2019re deluged with information about Trump on every level \u2013 as a man, as a politician. But what\u2019s significant to me is that all of his enormous mistakes and misstatements disappear within 24 hours. The national memory lasts 48 hours, at best. And there\u2019s always something else coming at us down the pipeline. You can\u2019t separate it all out. You get lost in the deluge.\u201d So what\u2019s the prognosis? DeLillo, God help us, is as discombobulated as anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know. I think it would take a great shift of events for the country to restore its balance, to restore its consciousness, and to think about things the way we did during the Obama administration.\u201d He sighs. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not sure the situation is recoverable.\u201d When he can no longer stomach the news, he visits the movies with his wife, Barbara Bennett, a former banker turned landscape designer. DeLillo \u2013 no surprise \u2013 has always loved cinema. He came of age on a diet of European arthouse (one catches glimmers of Antonioni and Godard in his playful, sculpted fiction). He once laid on a screening and talk about the Zapruder film that captured JFK\u2019s assassination. Last month, he binge-watched five pictures at the New York film festival. Trouble is, he\u2019s already forgotten the names. Mind like a sieve \u2013 it\u2019s a hazard of his age. Another laugh. \u201cI have to think hard to even remember my own work.\u201d I\u2019m trying to recall what just screened in New York. Did he catch Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma? \u201cNo!\u201d he says, stirred. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get in. But we saw a Polish film that was very good.\u201d Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s Cold War, about tragic lovers strung across the the iron curtain? \u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was very good. And beautifully filmed in black and white. I\u2019m all in favour of black and white. It\u2019s funny, I recently rewatched Children of Men.\u201d That\u2019s another Cuar\u00f3n film, about a society on the verge of collapse after decades of human infertility. \u201cI was very disappointed because I had remembered it in black and-white, and it wasn\u2019t. I had misremembered the film the way I wanted it to be. I mean, it\u2019s a strong piece of work either way, but it would be stronger if it had been in black and white.\u201d A few weeks ago, DeLillo attended the memorial service for Philip Roth at the New York Public Library. Roth, who died in May, was his sometime friend and one-time rival for the vexed and probably illusory title of Greatest Living American Writer. But the thing about Roth is that his death came at the end of a lengthy self-imposed retirement. The man spent his last eight years kicking about his apartment, periodically commenting on US politics and contentedly reading non-fiction. By all accounts, he did not miss writing one bit. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d says DeLillo. \u201cI don\u2019t think he did.\u201d Retirement, he thought, wouldn\u2019t suit him the same way. \u201cEverybody is different and there are always distractions. But I feel I have an idea in my mind I need to work on. And when I\u2019m able to sit down and put my fingers on the typewriter, things are moving along pretty well. These days I\u2019m much slower. I can\u2019t work at the same pace. But what the hell, I\u2019ll keep going. It\u2019s what\u2019s keeping me alive.\u201d \u2022 Love-Lies-Bleeding is at the Print Room at the Coronet, London, 9 November to 8 December.", "8||Antisemitism endangers us all. We can\u2019t afford to be complacentOn Saturday \u2013 exactly a week after the horrific attack in Pittsburgh \u2013 I had the privilege of attending a Shabbat service at a synagogue in London to show solidarity with the Jewish community, both here and around the world. We prayed for all those affected \u2013 the families, the friends and the wider Jewish community. This evening, I\u2019m also proud to be speaking at the annual dinner of the Board of Deputies of British Jews \u2013 a great organisation that does an incredible job standing up for the Jewish community in our country. Understandably, many Jewish Londoners \u2013 and Jewish communities around the world \u2013 are not only mourning the victims of the dreadful attack in Pittsburgh, but worried about what this means for their own safety. A synagogue should always be a sanctuary, a place where you feel safe to worship and practise your faith in peace. The wicked terrorist attack targeted innocent Jewish Americans, but it felt like an attack on us all \u2013 on our way of life and on the freedoms we hold dear. The fight against antisemitism is not only about protecting the Jewish community; it\u2019s a fight on behalf of everyone. For antisemitism is a threat to our values, to the cohesiveness of our communities and to our whole society. Sadly, the rise in antisemitism and the far right can\u2019t be treated simply as a passing trend. The Community Security Trust has reported that antisemitic incidents across the UK are at a record high, with the number of cases recorded in London alone rising by nearly 200% since 2011. We know from our history that we ignore these incidents at our peril, and where antisemitism, left to fester, can lead. And we know from our history that an increase in antisemitism and rightwing extremism usually comes with a rise in other forms of hate crime and division \u2013 coinciding with a backdrop of economic hardship, nationalist populism and political uncertainty. Worryingly, all the warning signs are here again, so it is vital that we take action now. In London, I\u2019m doing all I can to fight antisemitism. Under my leadership, the Met police is taking a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism, wherever it occurs. This includes within the Labour party, no matter how awkward others might find this. I\u2019ve also set up a countering violent extremism programme at City Hall, which is working to stop the spread of extremist ideologies of all kinds. But we must also encourage everyone, of all faiths and all backgrounds, to play their part in defeating this rise in hatred. This includes politicians, in this country and around the world, refraining from using the language of division to advance their political causes. Take the way President Trump is using immigration as a way to stoke up fear of migrants and to give credence to conspiracy theories ahead of this week\u2019s US midterm elections. His is one of the worst examples in recent times of this kind of irresponsible and damaging behaviour. It\u2019s also been revealing how many people from the Jewish community in Pittsburgh have been critical of Trump following the attack \u2013 because they know that his rhetoric and actions in recent years have been facilitating the rise of the far right across the US, which has emboldened some who wish to sow the seeds of hate. Depressingly, extreme views are now infiltrating the mainstream, with nationalist populist parties gaining strength in the US, across Europe and now in Brazil. We need to wake up to this threat from the far right and from the politics of blame and recrimination that\u2019s seeping into our national debates. A big part of any solution will be tackling the root causes of why more and more people are feeling left behind by globalisation, leading them to look to blame \u201cthe other\u201d for their ills. But we must also take immediate action to mend the growing divisions within our society. I\u2019m proud to represent such a forward-looking, global city. On the whole, we don\u2019t just tolerate differences in London, we respect and celebrate them. But we are still far from perfect \u2013 our communities have been changing rapidly and our sense of social cohesion is being put to the test as never before. One of the lessons from around the world is that a \u201chands-off\u201d approach to social integration simply doesn\u2019t work. And without action, the situation will only get worse. That\u2019s why I believe one of the most important tasks now is to take proactive steps towards building stronger and more integrated communities. This means we need to start encouraging and facilitating greater social integration wherever we can \u2013 to strengthen social ties and bonds of trust between people of all faiths, races, ages and backgrounds. There\u2019s not going to be a quick fix to this problem: it\u2019s one of the defining challenges of the 21st century. But I\u2019m still optimistic that if we treat it with the seriousness it deserves, we can clamp down on antisemitism, stop the march of far right and nationalist populism and make a real difference in forging stronger communities \u2013 showing that hope, unity and love can always trump fear, division and hatred. \u2022 Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London", "3||Pamela Pilkington obituaryMy mother, Pamela Pilkington, who has died aged 96, was one of the NHS\u2019s first female doctors. After retraining as a psychiatrist at the age of 50 she devoted herself to working in this field. She was born in Wandsworth, south-west London. Her father, Percy Jewell, ran a building company and was a domineering influence on her family. Her mother, Ivy (nee Ennis), relied heavily on Pam for support. Pam attended Mayfield girls\u2019 school in Putney. With steely determination she and her younger brother, Peter, developed high aspirations and a lifelong interest in politics. As a member of the Young Communist League in her early 20s, she volunteered to work on railway construction in Yugoslavia after the end of the second world war. She joined St George\u2019s hospital medical school in 1948, one of only a handful of women in the year\u2019s intake. In 1953 she married Thomas Pilkington, a fellow medic at St George\u2019s. After qualifying in medicine she practised as a microbiologist at St George\u2019s, before taking a 15-year break to raise her family. Pam dedicated herself completely to this role, using her boundless energy and patience to bring up her four children, Karen, Anna, Ed and me, at the family home in Kew. Strongly influenced by the experiences of her mother, who had suffered from severe depression, Pam returned to medicine and retrained in psychiatry at the age of 50. As a consultant at Long Grove hospital, Epsom, Surrey, she helped develop an adolescent service and established the adult psychiatric intensive care unit. She was highly regarded by her colleagues and dedicated herself to her patients with the same intensity that she had to everything else in her life. She blurred the boundaries between work and family life in ways that influenced us all, finally retiring from paid work at the age of 70. For years thereafter she volunteered at youth projects and was a board member of Off the Record, a pioneering youth counselling service. Pam was a rich and complicated character, with many powerful contradictions: a fit and strong woman who never exercised; a confidante to many, yet a terrible gossip; a great socialiser who hated parties. Following retirement she kept up a dizzying array of interests \u2013 enjoying music, theatre, wine and good food. She was also an active and dedicated grandmother, playing for hours with her grandchildren. She outlived Tom by seven years, moving to Highbury, north London, to live near her daughters, who cared for her in old age. She is survived by her children and by 12 grandchildren.", "2||Youth vote surging and backing Democrats in midterms, says Steyer-led groupYouth turnout in the 2018 midterm elections is expected to surge, according to new polling from NextGen America, a liberal advocacy group led by the billionaire Tom Steyer. NextGen America defines young voters as those between the age of 18 and 35. According to data provided to the Guardian by the group, 37% of young Americans in six key states say they will definitely vote or have already voted. In the 2014 midterms, only 23% voted. The data indicates that these voters lean heavily Democratic, preferring a Democrat to a Republican on a generic ballot by 59% to 33%. They also expressed a deep dissatisfaction with Donald Trump, with only 28% saying they would vote for his re-election as president. Only 30% of those polled had a favorable opinion of Trump, including a mere 25% of those who identified as independents. The states from which the voters were drawn \u2013 Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin \u2013 have been the focus of NextGen America\u2019s efforts to turn out young support for Democratic candidates. The group has been active in 11 states in all and has spent $33m. It also measured voter intensity among young voters, finding that young Democrats are more enthusiastic about voting in the six key states than in three states, Missouri, New Mexico and Tennessee, where the group has not been active. Demographically, the data showed significant divides. The gender gap seen across the electorate persisted, with women far more likely to support a Democratic candidate. Young female voters supported Democrats by 64% to 26%. Men backed them 52% to 41%. A divide was also found regarding education. Those without college degrees supported Democrats by 54% to 36%. Those with degrees did so by 62% to 29%. Tom Bonier, chief executive of TargetSmart, a top Democratic data firm, told the Guardian the \u201cyouth turnout is absolutely stunning\u201d. He added: \u201cOf course we were expecting to see a surge, as intensity increases across the board. What we didn\u2019t expect was to see the largest increases coming from younger voters \u2026 this is younger voters occupying a larger share of the electorate while older voters are seeing a diminishing electorate share.\u201d", "0||Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s sons appeal for father's body to be returnedJamal Khashoggi\u2019s sons have appealed to the Turkish and Saudi authorities to find and return their father\u2019s body for a family burial, as more details emerged about alleged Saudi attempts to cover up the truth about the dissident journalist\u2019s killing. Salah, 35, and Abdullah, 33, broke their silence a month after their father disappeared at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in an interview with CNN on Sunday, describing how difficult the last few weeks had been for the family and paying tribute to a man they called \u201ccourageous, generous and very brave\u201d. Salah, who was believed to have been subject to a travel ban preventing him form leaving the kingdom, flew to Washington DC with Abdullah, their two sisters and respective families two weeks ago, just after he was pictured shaking hands with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after being summoned to one of Riyadh\u2019s royal palaces. It is alleged that the powerful heir to the throne must have at a minimum been aware of the plan to kill Khashoggi, who had become increasingly critical of the Saudi royal family since moving to the US in self-imposed exile in 2017. When asked about his meeting with Prince Mohammed, which was widely criticised as a royal attempt at damage control, Salah said the visit had been \u201cover-analysed\u201d. The family is waiting for the results of the investigation into their father\u2019s killing to emerge and trusts King Salman to bring the perpetrators to justice, he added. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and officials from his ruling AK party have reiterated their belief in recent days that the \u201chighest levels\u201d of the Saudi establishment must have ordered the journalist\u2019s killing, as well as allegations that Saudi Arabia is incapable of carrying out an independent and unbiased criminal investigation. Riyadh\u2019s explanation for what happened to Khashoggi has changed several times. After two weeks of denials that the kingdom had anything to do with the journalist\u2019s disappearance, Saudi officials said that he had been killed during a fight with a team of rogue extradition agents, who had been arrested. A week later Saudi Arabia said the evidence compiled by Turkish investigators actually showed his killing had been \u201cpremeditated\u201d. The kingdom maintains that Khashoggi\u2019s body was wrapped in a rug and disposed of by a \u201clocal collaborator\u201d who has not been identified. His remains have still not been found \u2013 and Turkish investigators allege his body was cut up with a bone saw and either disposed of in rural areas outside the city or dissolved in acid in a garage under the nearby consul general\u2019s house. On Monday, Turkish newspaper Sabah, citing unnamed officials, said new evidence in the case showed that Khashoggi\u2019s body had been removed from the consulate in five suitcases, and that an 11-member team of Saudi investigators that arrived in Turkey nine days after he disappeared included a chemical expert and a toxicology expert, who removed evidence of the killing. Investigators found freshly painted surfaces during an initial search of the consulate building. Turkish officials have steadily leaked details from the investigation to local media, a strategy designed to keep up pressure on Prince Mohammed.", "22||Spice Girls announce reunion tour \u2013 without Victoria BeckhamWhen five become four (again): the Spice Girls have announced a 2019 tour without founding member Victoria Beckham. Melanie Chisholm, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton and Geri Horner (n\u00e9e Halliwell) will commence a six-date UK tour on 1 June 2019 at Manchester Etihad stadium with support from Jess Glynne. In a video announcing the reunion, they made no mention of their missing bandmate. A press release stated that Beckham \u2013 who has often displayed a self-awareness about her lack of natural musical talent \u2013 is concentrating on her fashion label, a career that has arguably given her the greatest post-pop success of any Spice Girls member. \u201cBeing in the Spice Girls was a hugely important part of my life and I wish my girls so much love and fun as they go back on tour,\u201d Beckham said in a statement. \u201cI know they will put on an amazing show and the fantastic fans past and present are going to have a wonderful time!\u201d Brown recently attended a Halloween party dressed as Beckham, holding up a sign that read: \u201cNo I am not going on tour.\u201d She was joined by boyfriend Gary Madatyan dressed as David Beckham, who held a sign that said: \u201cPlease, please, please do it for the Spice Girls fans.\u201d It will be the second time the band has toured with a reduced membership. Horner quit the Spice Girls in May 1998 prior to the group\u2019s first North American tour, which they completed without her. She rejoined the group in 2007 for their first reunion tour and a greatest hits collection that contained one new song, Headlines (Friendship Never Ends). The five-piece reunited for a one-off performance at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games. Further reunion tours have been rumoured ever since: in February 2018, the five held a meeting and indicated that they intended to work on new projects together. In May, Brown said that all five original members had signed on to work with former manager Simon Fuller. They began working with Fuller in 1995 after firing the father-son management team of Chris and Bob Herbert that put the group together in 1994. The group fired Fuller \u2013 who co-ordinated their many lucrative commercial partnerships \u2013 in November 1997 and took control of their affairs. The band\u2019s members have pursued a variety of projects since going on hiatus in 2000. Each of them has released solo music: Beckham had the shortest-lived musical career while Chisholm continues to release music under her own name. Brown has been a judge on the British version of the X Factor, among other TV talent shows. Bunton is a presenter on radio station Heart London and was recently announced as host of the US version of the Great British Bake Off. Horner has written children\u2019s books and been a judge on Australia\u2019s Got Talent. The news of their reunion has provoked a mixed response. \u201cLast time they toured, it felt as if there was unfinished business to sort out, particularly as it was the full lineup,\u201d said Popjustice editor Peter Robinson. \u201cBut after that massive tour and the release of new music a few years ago, I wonder what really remains unfinished in 2018.\u201d Robinson suggested that the best way for the group to have sustained their legacy would have been an international TV talent search to find the new Spice Girls. \u201cI\u2019d assume, with Simon Fuller involved, that this will be part of the rollout in the coming months.\u201d Broadcaster and author Miranda Sawyer suggested that the group\u2019s ages (between 42 and 46) could be a motivation for the reunion. \u201cThey\u2019ve hit middle age and that\u2019s when you question the whole of your life,\u201d said Sawyer, who wrote a book on middle age called Out of Time. \u201cYou look at your \u2018legacy\u2019 \u2013 and this happens to everyone, the Spice Girls or not \u2013 and think, what have I done with my life? And if the biggest thing you ever did was in your 20s, you may want to revisit that period.\u201d That, said Sawyer, was the likely reason for Beckham\u2019s non-participation. \u201cThe biggest and most important thing in her life is her family and her career \u2013 she has absolutely moved on and is having another life.\u201d David Sinclair, author of the biography Wannabe: How the Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fame, agreed that the group might want to relive former glories. \u201cThere must be a terrible feeling of loss that they were such a global phenomenon at a certain moment, but it didn\u2019t last that long. They were in a little bubble for a few years and it really was just whipped away. There must be a very strong urge to go back and recover that.\u201d Lauren Bravo, author of the new book What Would the Spice Girls Do: How the Girl Power Generation Grew Up, said she was not surprised by their comeback. \u201cIt takes 15 or 20 years for things to come back around again: the shops are full of revived 90s trends. Nineties kids had the feeling that all the important radical pop culture had happened before we were born \u2013 we were told that everything we had was a pallid rehash of the 60s and 70s \u2013 so it is nice to look back and think, that was important.\u201d BBC Radio 1 presenter Clara Amfo often plays Spice Girls songs on her mid-morning weekday show and said they always receive a positive response. She welcomed the tour. \u201cDo I think they should bring out a brand-new album and singles? I lean towards no. It\u2019s all about celebration and nostalgia \u2013 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re coming for Little Mix\u2019s wigs. They know they\u2019re the elder stateswomen of the pop sphere.\u201d Many of today\u2019s pop musicians who were children during the Spice Girls\u2019 heyday have cited them as an influence, from Adele to British avant-garde pop star Charli XCX and Danish singer M\u00d8. British singer Jess Glynne will support the group on the tour. \u201cThey were a massive part of my childhood and if you told little me that I would be sharing a stage with them when I\u2019m older, I couldn\u2019t even tell you my response,\u201d she said. The Spice Girls\u2019 \u201cgirl power\u201d message has also been cited as a cornerstone of many millennials\u2019 grounding in feminism. \u201cThe band are relevant in the sense that girl power lives on in a generation of women who were introduced to a very basic interpretation of feminism two decades before books on the topic became the ultimate middle-class stocking filler,\u201d said Robinson. Sawyer acknowledged that some people are \u201csnotty\u201d about their conception of feminism. \u201cI understand why, but I think if you are a young girl and someone says \u2018girl power\u2019 to you, that is very important. Their idea that your girlfriends might be more important than the boys you were meant to be attracting is still quite a fundamental point really.\u201d Said Bravo: \u201cThey gave us permission to be outspoken \u2013 \u2018gobby\u2019 was a word that was often flung around \u2013 and angry, and have an opinion whether or not we were considered qualified. That\u2019s something we\u2019re still struggling with today: who\u2019s doing it right, who\u2019s doing it wrong? They were criticised for being too brash, too commercial, but the fact that they were commercial and successful meant they reached a young audience, and that was their power.\u201d Dazed digital editor Aimee Cliff questioned whether the Spice Girls\u2019 \u201cThatcher-endorsing brand of girl power\u201d would hold up. \u201cTheir patriotism and Union Jack-waving would feel hollow and Brexit-esque. Their unrelenting optimism would be at odds with a more cynical audience, and a bleaker time for the UK in general. Relevant? Maybe not. But the bangers are forever.\u201d \u2022 Tickets for the tour go on sale at 10.30am on 10 November.

Doing so in a thoroughly mainstream manner are duo Ider, who have built a solid following with their unaffected live shows and highly relatable Gen-Z pop. Mirror is their best track yet, an upbeat power ballad that sees them beautifully harmonising about a loss of self in the wake of a breakup. \u201cYou chose to leave,\u201d one of them repeats, but it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 they\u2019re still checking when he was last online, and don\u2019t recognise themselves during a night-time trip to the bathroom. Mirror pulls off one of pop\u2019s trickiest tasks: being intimate and huge all at once. Donae\u2019o \u2013 Chalice (feat Belly) A true British journeyman, Donae\u2019o has perhaps suffered from being a jack of all trades. Across more than a decade he\u2019s done UK funky, wobble-bass EDM and Afrobeats, all while rocking a logo that looks like a bad tribal tattoo you\u2019d pick up drunk in Magaluf. But after scoring an underground hit with the uniquely hectic-yet-poised My Circle, he\u2019s gone down a more credible path, producing beautifully spacious, funky and sleazy tracks for Giggs: Lock Doh and Linguo. New single Chalice slightly tweaks the formula for his next rung up the ladder, with US rapper Belly guesting, and Calvin Harris on production, whose piano chords halfway through are an unexpectedly great switch-up. Bruce \u2013 What More evidence that Bristol is the nexus of dance culture in the UK \u2013 where techno, dub and experimentalism feed back on each other \u2013 comes from producer Bruce, who has turned in the biggest, smartest banger of 2018. It is based around a creepy, ultra-populist rave melody that the Chemical Brothers wish they\u2019d come up with, but he feeds in all manner of much weirder stuff: a time-stretched R&amp;B vocal (points to anyone who can spot what it is), seething snares, and bass noises that blur angrily across bar divides. This will have formed the dark peak of so many recent techno sets: four minutes of reality-splintering mayhem. Architects \u2013 Royal Beggars Near-unimaginable pain was the crucible for the forthcoming album from the arena-filling British metalcore band: the death from skin cancer of guitarist and songwriter Tom Searle, brother of drummer Dan. You can, if you wish, choose to hear their catharsis in this sensational single taken from it: a blast of focused, excoriating hard rock with a clear-headed chorus melody. But the open-ended lyrics could be a parable for any number of things: male inadequacy perhaps, or a politically fractious Britain. The lick of sarcasm from throat-shredder Sam Carter \u2013 \u201cYou may not have noticed / We have totally lost our way\u201d \u2013 is particularly savage in its bitterness. Deerhunter \u2013 Death in Midsummer Bradford Cox\u2019s coaxing husk of a voice could be leading you anywhere: it always contains a seditious invitation that may or may not be trustworthy. On Death in Midsummer, the first single from their recently announced album Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared?, it is set against a spindly, stately harpsichord riff from co-producer Cate Le Bon that gives Cox\u2019s entreaties a picaresque feel. He uses that sage mysticism of his to draw attention to fading ways of life: the manual labour superseded by technology, and the noticing of it subsumed by self-interest. \u201cWalk around and you\u2019ll see how it fades,\u201d he suggests, as euphoric bursts and a sidling, cosmic guitar solo cast things in a dazzling new light. Gorgeous. Heather Leigh \u2013 Soft Seasons The keening sound of pedal steel guitar is generally associated with country crooners, but Scotland-via-Texas musician Heather Leigh uses it in a much more exploratory way: drawing out gothic ambience, cascades of noise and pealing doom-metal chords. This gloriously heavy sound is topped by her querulous vocals, that recall Kate Bush at her wild and windiest. It all hangs together on her brilliant new album Throne, with Soft Seasons a highlight. \u201cWon\u2019t you say my name / It\u2019s my only desire,\u201d she pleads across a dark expanse of pedal steel, like PJ Harvey jamming with Earth. Sheck Wes \u2013 WESPN One of the longest slow-burns of the year is Mo Bamba by Sheck Wes \u2013 released in June 2017, but finally building up a head of steam a year later for its magnificently simple, out-of-tune terrace chant of a chorus. The New York rapper has now brought out his debut album and he sets out his stall in one track thus: \u201cSimiles and metaphors, that bullshit.\u201d So instead of wordplay there is a forever-unspooling stream of self-aggrandisement, punctuated by bracingly high-pitched exclamations of \u201cbitch!\u201d On a purely lyrical level it\u2019s narrow-minded, and the influence of Bay Area outsider Lil B is conspicuous, but it\u2019s all so free associative and unbothered with metre that it becomes mesmerising \u2013 as on meandering, wondering ballad WESPN. Pistol Annies \u2013 Best Years of My Life The country supergroup comprising Angaleena Presley, Miranda Lambert and Ashley Monroe are almost painfully astute on the subject of female sadness. On Best Years of My Life, they sketch a dejected housewife contemplating \u201ca recreational Percocet\u201d and losing herself in the \u201cintellectual emptiness\u201d of TV re-runs to blank out the reality of her fading fortunes: the loveless marriage and the \u201c10-cent town\u201d that\u2019s about to break her. A lengthy pedal steel and guitar solo, coupled with the trio\u2019s harmonies, only make it more devastating, hinting at the size of the chasm in their heroine\u2019s life. Thom Yorke \u2013 Unmade While much of his Suspiria soundtrack is probably best enjoyed in the confines of the cinema, at its heart, Yorke delivers a true classic for the ballad section of his best-of. Unmade has a little of Pyramid Song in the way its piano shifts unexpectedly on the offbeat, but is guileless and certain in the way so few Radiohead songs are. Perhaps when the film comes out, the song\u2019s entreaties to \u201ccome under my wings \u2026 I swear that there\u2019s nothing up my sleeve\u201d will actually be quite creepy, but shorn from the screen this is Yorke at his most moving. Julia Jacklin \u2013 Body With a backing at almost Low-levels of minimalism \u2013 steady drum, bassline, piano, and guitar pressing slowly forward like a rubbernecking car \u2013 this is a hypnotic and compulsively replayable anti-torch song. Australian singer-songwriter Jacklin tells a tale of a possibly charismatic but essentially terrible boyfriend who gets busted for smoking on a plane, thus ruining their trip. She leaves him, and gets outta there with a quiet rush of self-actualisation: \u201cI felt the changing of the seasons / All of my senses rushing back to me \u2026 Eyes on the driver, hands in my lap / Heading to the city to get my body back.\u201d You can feel her horizons open up as the song trudges smoothly onward.", "8||Why I\u2019m so glad I talked to my dad about #MeToo before he diedIf you had asked me, a year ago, what I might one day write about in my father\u2019s eulogy, I doubt I would have said feminism and structural misogyny in the Harvey Weinstein era. But when my dad unexpectedly passed away last December, that is exactly what kept circling around in my head. You see, Dad and I had had a falling-out about the #MeToo movement several weeks earlier, and our hours-long overseas phone call resolving that argument was one of the last heartfelt conversations we had. It genuinely brought us closer together. Now, a year after #MeToo, as I reflect on how the world has changed over the past year, I wonder if enough dads and daughters have had these talks. I recently read a column about daughters protecting their fathers from their sexual assault stories. I can identify with that; my dad was my closest confidant, role model, and the person I looked up to most. I hated disagreeing with him, and I knew it would upset him if I challenged him on his #MeToo comments. Now, I am so glad I did. Do not get me wrong. Dad was in many ways a feminist. He demonstrated that in his personal and professional life. He knew women deserve the same freedoms and opportunities as men; he married a smart, confident doctor and they raised me to believe I could do anything I wanted. What I took issue with, however, was my father\u2019s belief that the #MeToo battle was not his to fight. Like many men, he remained silent when my mum and I, and many other woman we knew, posted about our sexual harassment or assault experiences on social media. In fact, I had been posting similar things for years, and while my dad never disbelieved those stories, he also never reached out to talk about them. Once he actually told me I had a tendency to \u201covershare\u201d. And when the #MeToo hashtag gained steam last year, he wanted to be sure I knew that not all men were perpetrators. I could tell Dad had no idea how frustrated this made me. I called him one night, and was so upset I could barely choke out any words through my tears. He was at work and there was a seven-hour time difference, but he was audibly shocked, and agreed to arrange a time for a proper conversation that weekend. In the meantime, I assembled and sent him a document with terminology, from \u201cmansplaining\u201d to \u201cemotional labour\u201d, and links to articles on how men should respond to the movement. Because my dad and I were so close, I knew he would take it seriously. By the time we spoke, he had read every article I sent and discussed them with my mother too. He listened to me for hours, and we ran through scenarios in which he might have upset women in his life. We also talked about how he could use his platforms \u2013 his popularity on Twitter, for example, and his position as the chief executive of a small business \u2013 to effect change. I could tell Dad disagreed with me at times, but he bit his tongue and continued to make an effort. He said he never wanted to become a \u201cstuffy old guy\u201d, set in his ways, and he certainly did not want me to see him as such. He told me he did not want there to be anything I felt I could not discuss with him. Over the past year, a number of men have privately thanked me for bringing everyday sexism to their attention through my willingness to talk openly about it. Others, however, have clearly not been paying attention. One middle-aged friend leaps to mind. Every time I am harassed and publicise it on Facebook, this man responds as though it were a one-off incident. He gets defensive when my friends or I point to the structural sexism we face, and suggests there are simply good people and bad people but it has nothing to do with gender. This worries me, because he has a teenage daughter. Statistically speaking, she is likely to experience some form of sexual harassment or assault in her life, if she hasn\u2019t already. I desperately want to tell him to get over himself and start listening to women \u2013 for her sake. One day his daughter is going to need someone to talk to, and I hope she feels she can turn to him. So, fathers: when your daughters open up about the disadvantages and dangers they face, listen to and believe them. Do not make them think they must bear those burdens alone. Put your politics, or your hypotheticals, or your righteous indignation, aside. Acknowledge that for your daughters, sexual harassment is not theoretical but most likely very real, and they could probably use a friendly ear. And, daughters: while it is not our job to educate the men around us, consider starting a conversation if you feel you can. We can change the world, one mindset at a time, and for me that started with my dad. I remember telling him, after our phone call, how relieved I was that he had been open to criticism and willing to change. I told him I had always respected him, and wanted to be able to continue doing so. I did not know how little time we had left together but, because of that heart-to-heart last year, I can now honestly say I will respect him for the rest of my life. And in the end, writing his eulogy was easy: \u201cDad made every effort to better understand the world from my perspective, and had no problem admitting he could be wrong,\u201d I wrote. \u201cHe proved that everyone can learn, change, and continue to progress \u2013 even, as he would say, \u2018old dudes\u2019 like himself.\u201d This year, as the #MeToo hashtag resurfaces, I will be thinking of my dad. And I will find comfort in knowing he used his platform to broadcast his support for women. As I browse his Twitter feed for the message he sent after our talk, I realise just how many more times he voiced his support in the ensuing weeks. He never mentioned it; he was not looking for praise. I know he did it because he had come to understand just how important it was. \u2022 Portia Crowe is a journalist", "22||Rihanna and Axl Rose hit out at Donald Trump's use of their music at ralliesRihanna and Guns N\u2019 Roses frontman Axl Rose are the latest artists to criticise Donald Trump for the unauthorised use of their music at his rallies in the runup to the US mid-term elections on Tuesday. After the Washington Post\u2019s White House bureau chief, Philip Rucker, said that Rihanna\u2019s 2007 single Don\u2019t Stop the Music was being played by Trump at a rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the Bajan singer replied, saying: \u201cNot for much longer\u201d and described Trump\u2019s rallies as \u201ctragic\u201d. Rihanna\u2019s rebuke to the president came hours after she endorsed Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida, in an Instagram post.

The 4ft 8in, 105lb sprite from suburban Houston had emerged as a once-in-a-lifetime talent even before her star-making coronation at the Rio Olympics, where she fulfilled her long-held promise with four gold medals in seven unforgettable days. Turns of phrase, margins of victory, records broken: these languages are entirely ill-suited for translating her unique physical genius, which, truly, must be seen to be believed. That Biles is the best athlete in America today, which she is, feels like an undersell. Take her showing at last week\u2019s world championships, where the 21-year-old became the first woman to win a fourth all-around world title and the most decorated female gymnast ever. The outcome itself was unremarkable: Biles has won every major team and individual all-around competition she\u2019s entered since her senior career began in 2013, a dumbfounding run of consistency that prompted the sport\u2019s cognoscenti to declare her the most talented gymnast in history before she\u2019d competed in an Olympics. What stood out was that Biles, one could reasonably argue, was having the worst big competition of her career \u2013 and she still won a medal in every single event. What can you say about that? Last week\u2019s championships in Doha marked Biles\u2019 first international meet since winning the Olympic all-around championship, the sport\u2019s most coveted title. Maybe it was the rust of a two-year layoff, which included more than 14 months away from the gym and those famous six-hour-a-day, six-day-a-week training sessions. Or that she\u2019d spent the night before the competition began in an emergency room with a kidney stone that was too big to pass, and was left with no alternative but to soldier through the pain since doping regulations precluded her from prescription medication that could have alleviated the discomfort. Whatever it was, Biles was not herself in Thursday\u2019s all-around. She sat down on her vault in the opening rotation, marking her first fall in more than 60 career routines at worlds or the Olympics. The shock only redoubled when Biles fell off the beam in the third rotation, prompting a look of consternation that not even her outstanding performances on the uneven bars and floor exercise could fully erase. Yet Biles not only won but won by a record margin, outpacing Japan\u2019s Mai Murakami by 1.693 points. Even not at her best, she was the best. And it wasn\u2019t particularly close. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t show who I am,\u201d a disappointed Biles said afterward, the gold medal dangling from her neck. \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of disappointing.\u201d The American\u2019s two falls might have proven fatal under the perfect-10 judging system that governed the sport until 2006, where maximum scores were capped and falls were a mandatory half-point deduction. But the current open-ended system includes a difficulty score that accounts for more than one-third of the final tally \u2013 and Biles\u2019 \u201cd-score\u201d for the all-around was 2.7 points greater than any of her competitors (compared to 0.6 higher in Rio). Falls under the present rules are an automatic full-point deduction, but the start values for Biles\u2019 routines give her a cushion that\u2019s practically insurmountable. For years the most common refrain underpinning Biles\u2019 greatness was that she could fall multiple times and still win, but after a half-decade of metronomic consistency the theory was finally put to the test on Thursday \u2013 and it passed comfortably. She could have fallen a third time and still taken gold. \u201cInstead of thinking I could win,\u201d said Murakami, whose score would have earned the gold in Biles\u2019 absence last year, \u201cI was thinking: \u2018Oh, Biles can fall.\u2019\u201d Thursday\u2019s result might have been controversial if Biles\u2019 supremacy, her ability to perform skills no other woman in the world could even credibly attempt in competition, wasn\u2019t plainly evident. The fact is, Biles is so far ahead of everyone else it\u2019s almost embarrassing. She\u2019s performing elements an entire generation of successors will struggle to approach and it\u2019s hard to recall having seen anything like it before in any sport. Where the old system rewarded competitors for downgrading their routines, the current rules incentivize the sort of boundary-pushing athleticism that, it must be said, elevates gymnastics as a spectator sport. There\u2019s no room for playing it safe. Say what you want about it, but open-ended scoring encourages competitors to push their craft forward, the purest distillation of the Olympic spirit: Faster, Higher, Stronger. Biles\u2019 uneven routines in Qatar weren\u2019t limited to the all-around, but there were far more peaks than troughs during the week. She managed a silver medal in the bars after a 14th-place finish on the apparatus in Rio, showing off a dramatic improvement in her weakest discipline. The overall haul of four golds, a silver and a bronze makes her the first American to medal in every event at a major competition \u2013 team, all-around, vault, bars, beam and floor \u2013 and the first woman of any nationality to do it since Romania\u2019s Daniela Silivas at the 1988 Olympics. She capped her record-breaking week with a gold in Saturday\u2019s floor exercise final. It\u2019s long been Biles\u2019 favorite discipline, not simply because it offers the broadest canvas to showcase her uniquely brilliant physical skills, but because it scarcely feels like a discipline at all. (As her former coach Aimee Boorman told me in Rio, that\u2019s where \u201cshe just plays\u201d.) There are few analogues in sports for the slack-jawed wonder that Biles elicits on the floor. To behold her spacetime-cheating routine to clinch her fourth gold on Saturday was like watching Vince Carter flouting gravity in the NBA dunk contest or Maradona slaloming through half the England team at Azteca Stadium. After the most trying competitive week of her life, it offered the clearest callback to her Rio breakout and, perhaps, a glimmer of what\u2019s to come. The records will only continue to topple in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics. Biles is now level with Russia\u2019s Svetlana Khorkina as the most decorated female gymnast in world championships history with 20 career medals and will almost certainly eclipse Vitaly Scherbo\u2019s all-time mark for either gender (23) at next year\u2019s worlds in Stuttgart. And then Tokyo, where she can become the oldest woman in more than five decades to win the Olympic all-around title and the first repeat champion since Vera Caslavska did it for the former Czechoslovakia in 1968. The greatest champions are defined not by winning when they\u2019re peaking and all the tumblers are aligned in their favor, yet by how they persist and problem-solve and pull it from the bag when they\u2019re not at their best. But for Biles, who remains so far ahead of everyone it\u2019s going to take the sport years to catch up, the stakes of those gut-check moments are notably subdued. Her only competition is herself. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2018 to correct the spelling of Svetlana Khorkina\u2019s name.", "3||Tell us: has your company adopted a living wage policy?Staff of some 4,700 employers who have adopted a voluntary living wage policy are in line for an inflation-beating pay rise.

I remember Great Aunt May in her bib apron, slicing bread in the kitchen of her sister\u2019s (my granny\u2019s) pub in Oldham. The white tin loaf was usually so fresh that the insides hadn\u2019t firmed up, so May would stand it on one end, cut the crust off the other, then butter the end of the loaf. Dad says she then tucked the loaf under her arm like a newspaper and sawed off a ready-buttered slice, while Mum says she kept it end-up on the board and sliced like that. We have similar discussions about how May fried chips, and her stew with half a cow\u2019s heel. Humdrum conversations that are full of important bits: May, who was always \u201cour May\u201d, is not just remembered, but seems alive when we talk about how she sliced bread. I also remember May and Granny slicing oven-bottom cakes in the pub kitchen. These were not cakes at all, but saucer-sized bread buns with firm, flat bottoms because they were cooked at the bottom of the baker\u2019s oven. They also had floury tops, which meant you got floury fingers, which you inevitably wiped on your trousers, so got floury trousers. At the pub, oven-bottom cakes were split and filled with bacon, flash-fried steaks or slices of cheese. As kids, my brother and sister and I would sit on high stools up at the bar, shuffling beer mats or rumpling beer towels, then squashing the two halves and the filling of our lunch together so the bacon with its fat, the hot beef or slices of cheese sank into the crumb. As we ate, the floury tops would stick to the roofs of our mouths, until we washed them down with lemonade. It is the same stickiness with the brash and satisfying boiled beef panini at Sergio\u2019s Mordi e Vai stall on Testaccio market, which you wash down with Peroni (if that is not your thing, you take your own beer). Or with Sandro\u2019s mozzarella and tomato ciabatta at his Fraschetta \u2013 the last in Testaccio, which you wash down with half a litre of functional vino. The same kind of sticky comes with every three-cornered, white-sliced, tuna-and-tomato tramezzino in every bar all over Italy. In fact, I have come to the conclusion \u2013 and you may not agree with me \u2013 that all sandwiches should stick to the roof of your mouth, even if just for a moment. Then there are the panini al latte \u2013 milk buns \u2013 from the perennially good Roman bakery Passi. The Italian cousin of the English milk loaf May bought from Hough\u2019s, these buns are slightly sweet and creamy inside \u2013 undoubtedly childlike, but not just for children. Like the tin loaf, they demand to be eaten fresh from the oven, split and filled with anything you fancy \u2013 which for me means a slice of prosciutto and some cream cheese or a spoonful of strawberry jam. At Passi, the panini are the size of a doorknob \u2013 arguably bite-sized, which means you can eat four in one go, 10 at a children\u2019s party. If what looks like a small door knob rises into a big bun in the oven, then two is probably enough for a meal, which might just stick to the roof of your mouth.

For those nights when we want food on the table fast, I regularly buy mushrooms. There is little as good as sauteed mushrooms on toast (think butter, garlic, parsley and creme fraiche), but here I thought I would try to recreate an exquisite plate of street food I had one late night in Bangkok. It is a real treat. Sweet and sticky mushrooms with jasmine rice and spring onions (pictured above) Ginger, garlic, chilli, oyster sauce: it is hard to see how this collection of ingredients couldn\u2019t be delicious. The ultimate fast-food plate. Prep 15 min Cook 20 min Serves 4 350g jasmine rice, rinsed thoroughly Salt 600g small chestnut and shiitake mushrooms, stems separated 2 tbsp cornflour 4 tbsp groundnut oil 1 \u00bd tbsp sesame oil 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 1 thumb ginger, peeled and finely chopped 2 tbsp oyster sauce 1 tbsp light soy sauce 3 tbsp rice wine vinegar \u00bd tsp cornflour, mixed with 1 tsp water 6 spring onions, finely sliced 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds Chilli oil, sliced red chillies or sriracha, to serve Blanched pak choi, to serve Put the rice in a medium saucepan with a lid and pour 600ml boiling water over. Add a pinch of salt, bring to a boil, cover and turn the heat down to low. Simmer gently for 15 minutes, then take off the heat, remove the lid, fluff up the grains with a fork and put the lid back on, slightly ajar. Keep the rice warm while you prepare the mushrooms. Put the mushrooms in a bowl and toss with the cornflour so they\u2019re lightly covered. Warm the groundnut oil in a wok over a high heat and fry the mushrooms in batches for two to three minutes, until golden. Remove and drain on kitchen paper. Wipe the wok clean, then return it to a medium heat and warm up the sesame oil. When hot, add the garlic and ginger, fry for a moment until fragrant, then add the oyster sauce, soy, two tablespoons of the vinegar and the cornflour paste. Leave to simmer for a minute or two, toss in the cooked mushrooms, then fold them in until they are covered in the sauce. Stir through the spring onions and sesame seeds. Spoon the rice into bowls, shake over a little of the remaining vinegar, spoon the mushrooms on top and serve with slices of fresh chilli or chilli oil and some blanched greens. And for the rest of the week You can cook other vegetables in this style, too. Aubergines work beautifully, as do courgettes.

Even though the anonymous-ish slow-jam queen doesn\u2019t remove her mirrored sunglasses throughout our meeting. Even though this means for a whole hour I\u2019m basically looking at my own reflection as we sit in the sweet breeze of an air-conditioned hotel lobby in Midtown, Atlanta. Even though I kind of have to go along with the idea that I don\u2019t know the real identity of HER, despite the fact that the most rudimentary Google brings up her full name, age and detailed career history. HER is in fact Gabi Wilson, a singer and multi-instrumentalist from Vallejo, California, who was discovered, aged 10, performing on daytime TV in the US, scooped up by Alicia Keys\u2019s management company and signed to RCA at 14. Although it doesn\u2019t seem to have turned her into a Kids from Fame brat, it isn\u2019t hard to work out that this semi-retreat from the spotlight is about her regaining agency over her identity. Like Sia, Daft Punk and pre-mega fame the Weeknd, HER is as much about the commodification of mystery as she is the music, and like Clark Kent, sunglasses are always worn. This is despite the protestations of her 1.2 million Instagram followers, who are constantly flooding her comments with pleas to \u201cshow your face!\u201d. \u201cI wanted to be anonymous,\u201d says HER, dressed down like any other 21-year-old on a Saturday afternoon in jeans, a black T-shirt and trainers, the only concessions to her ludicrous streaming stats and star status apparent in her huge glossy curls and aforementioned sunglasses. The decision certainly wasn\u2019t due to a lack of confidence on HER\u2019s part \u2013 just check YouTube for clips of Gabi Wilson performing on telly to millions as a kid, as relaxed as can be. Instead, she says it was down to how open her lyrics were. Though not especially candid, there\u2019s a lot of gloomy heartbreak here: there\u2019s wasted emotions, plenty of \u201cif I can\u2019t be with you what\u2019s the point, really?\u201d. This is music to mope to. Music to dump and be dumped to. This is in no small part down to the first two HER EPs being written from the ages of 14 to 18, a time when even an ignored WhatsApp message can result in weeks of sobbing into a pillow. \u201cLiving my truth was very hard \u2013 I felt vulnerable,\u201d she says of her reasoning behind releasing music as HER. \u201cSome people ask me: \u2018Is it an alter ego, is it another version of yourself?\u2019 But it\u2019s just my inner self. It\u2019s all the thoughts and feelings that sit in the back of my mind and I\u2019m afraid to say.\u201d With this approach to privacy and self-protection, then, it seems strange that HER would want to speak to journalists at all. In fact, it\u2019s only in the past year or so she\u2019s actually felt comfortable talking to the press. \u201cIt took me a while to want to do interviews,\u201d she explains. \u201cPeople always make me uncomfortable when they ask me: \u2018Who\u2019s this song about?\u2019 I feel like I let you read my diary and now we have to have a conversation about it! I already let you read it, let\u2019s just leave it at that.\u201d So what is HER\u2019s life like beyond the music? She has three pet snakes that live with her in her apartment in Brooklyn (she shows me pictures on her phone of her favourite, Mike). She\u2019s all grins when she recounts the tale of how her mother wooed her father by cooking him meals from her native Philippines when they lived in opposite apartment buildings in the Bay Area. And she practically floats when speaking about taking her 12-year-old sister on tour. \u201cWhen I mean private I mean I don\u2019t have a clique,\u201d she says, positioning herself away from the Justin Biebers of the world. \u201cYou won\u2019t see me out with so and so. All the gossip \u2013 I\u2019m not about that at all. The drama.\u201d Yet, despite HER\u2019s commitment to being low-key, the big names can\u2019t keep away. An invaluable co-sign from Rihanna bought her tune Focus to the attention of millions; Alicia Keys has been coaching her for the past decade; and she\u2019s here in Atlanta to pay tribute to her latest fan, Janet Jackson, at a glitzy industry ceremony. It was backstage at KOKO after a sold-out London show earlier this year that HER found the 52-year-old pop icon waiting in the wings to say how much she loved her music. \u201cI\u2019ve had many big sisters in the industry and it\u2019s a beautiful thing to have so many mentors,\u201d says HER, reverentially. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to feel pressures being a female artist \u2013 pressure to look a certain way, to act a certain way, to conform. And having that support from another woman is confirmation that you\u2019re doing exactly what you\u2019re supposed to be doing, which is to stay true to yourself.\u201d But there is a contradiction here. She may be outspoken about how her music can empower women, but she also went on tour with Chris Brown, the man who pleaded guilty to violently assaulting his girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. \u201cHe has a past \u2026 We\u2019re all human, we\u2019re all imperfect \u2013 not excusing or justifying anything \u2013 but he admires my art and I admire his, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about, the celebration of art,\u201d she says of the rapper. Adjusting her glasses, she pauses to reflect on her own approach as soberly as she does on Brown\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t focus on the controversy. I don\u2019t focus on anything other than the art.\u201d That \u201cart\u201d is part of a new wave flooding R&amp;B. Indie and dance have always had a place for the loners \u2013 James Blake, Burial, Aphex Twin et al \u2013 but it\u2019s a stance that seems at odds with soul\u2019s more boombastic roots. Yet since the Weeknd uploaded his first tracks to YouTube in 2011 under the cryptic username xoxxxoooxo, confusing and delighting music bloggers in equal measure, the genre hasn\u2019t been as reliant on star power as it once was. More recently, there\u2019s been the shy, almost reclusive Bryson Tiller, who guests on HER\u2019s latest EP, I Used to Know Her: The Prelude EP, and SZA, who\u2019s less about TMZ headlines and more about making you cry about your ex from sixth form. \u201cIt\u2019s not even about the glamour and the crazy personality any more, it\u2019s just about what do you make me feel with your music and your words,\u201d explains HER. \u201c[It\u2019s about] all the underdogs, the people who weren\u2019t the most popular in school or the people who were told they weren\u2019t gonna be anything. But they really have a story to show the world and people can identify with them.\u201d She chuckles throatily when I ask if she\u2019ll ever remove the glasses. Is it part of a marketing plan? Are there meeting rooms filled with label interns figuring out tactics to launch a star? \u201cEventually you\u2019re gonna have to see my face. But there\u2019s no PowerPoint presentation involved.\u201d I Used to Know Her: The Prelude EP is out now", "1||England will need more than resilience to get better of New ZealandIf there is one thing England can be sure of against New Zealand it is that the All Blacks will be nowhere near as wasteful in the red zone as South Africa. Eddie Jones and his players will know that and while England must take huge credit for their guts and tenacity, this was a game they set out not to lose \u2013 and squeezed home by dodging a bullet right at the death. Having said that, I expect Saturday\u2019s match to be a lot closer than people may think. I was talking to Joe Marler before the Springboks game and explaining just how wary the All Blacks are of playing at Twickenham. England have lost only once \u2013 to Ireland \u2013 there under Eddie and they are a different beast at home. Eddie is right to say the All Blacks will be completely different to the Springboks and try and hold on to the ball more, but Twickenham is a funny old ground and you have to play the territorial game. New Zealand will not be short of confidence and when I\u2019ve watched them recently, they\u2019ve clearly been trying things and putting themselves under pressure. Sometimes they\u2019ve been holding on to the ball religiously, not kicking at all to test their threshold with ball in hand, but the All Blacks will be coming to win. That\u2019s all that matters because a win away to England would be hugely significant before the World Cup. This is the game that everyone has been talking about for the past four years. In terms of positives for England, they hung in there and showed their resilience. Those were the soundbites coming out of the dressing room afterwards but those are qualities that should not be underestimated. It was a match they should have lost \u2013 Owen Farrell effectively kept them in it and eventually got them home \u2013 but they will take heart from how they turned things round in the second half. The defensive system has changed considerably under John Mitchell. The players are changing from watching the ball, which is Guzzy\u2019s [Paul Gustard] style, to watching the man now, and that takes time to bed in. That seemed to be the problem in the first half \u2013 they weren\u2019t comfortable with what they were doing so they were going high and soaking tackles, and in doing so allowing South Africa over the gain-line. Once they got their tackle heights down and brought a bit more sting it allowed others to get over the ball \u2013 Tom Curry would have had a field day if he had stayed on. And as the momentum shifted and the game opened up we got a better idea of what England were trying to do in attack. They were filling the field, taking advantage of some kamikaze defending from South Africa\u2019s wings and putting Brad Shields in the wide channels. You saw the two forward runners in the little spoon shape off 10, running hard, and second-man plays out the back, linking up with the back three to get into the wide channels. I could see the shape but they just need to do it for longer. The ability to hold on to the ball for longer periods of time in the right areas of the field is going to be crucial. Elliot Daly was a bit of a culprit \u2013 he kept on cutting back inside rather than getting the ball in the hands of Jonny May and Jack Nowell. That may mean a change to the back three and elsewhere; if Manu Tuilagi is fit I would expect him to start. The All Blacks will know the threat he poses and even if he is not the same player as when he was so destructive against them in 2012, he is as dangerous as anyone when used as a short runner for his go-forward. In the negatives column for England I worry about Maro Itoje\u2019s discipline \u2013 it is becoming a bit of a theme at this level and they will have no chance on Saturday if they have such little territory and possession because you can\u2019t sustain that against the All Blacks. The mood in the camp will be so much better than had they lost though, and England will get better with another week\u2019s training and the chance to add some detail. I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019ll be enough.", "16||Should I dress more smartly for work?Does it matter what I wear to work? I like to be comfortable but occasionally catch a glimpse of myself in the lifts (I work in advertising) and think I look a hot mess. Will that hold me back? The short answer to \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d is yes and no. No one can be on point with their outfit every day. That\u2019s why they invented uniforms. I tend to start the week in what I call \u201ccosy clothes\u201d, a tracksuit or a jumper. I probably look a \u201chot mess\u201d, too, but it means I can be focused. The beginning of the week is when I do the school run, and don\u2019t tend to arrange any meetings. So I\u2019m happy to wear whatever I want. When it gets to Wednesday and my son goes to his father\u2019s for the latter part of the week, I start pulling out the outfits I love, and go to see people I need to make an impression on. It makes me feel good to switch it up and have glam days and chill days. When I like my look, I feel more confident about my meetings. Advertising, I can imagine, is very image-based and of course you feel a certain pressure to look good. But do you feel a mess because you know you haven\u2019t made an effort, or because you feel you ought to look good for your colleagues and clients? Neither is the \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d approach, but it\u2019s always good to consider why you feel the way you do. Only you can know whether your look is so lax that it will hold you back. We live in a selfie- and image-obsessed world: do you want to play that game, or do you want to do your job? Remember, there\u2019s a risk that the more presentable you are, the more people want you around merely for decoration (not to mention how relentless the upkeep is). Would looking smarter enhance your ability to do your job? Do what feels right for you, and what will help you achieve your goals at work.

But really it\u2019s more like 60. Or 600. Hadestown has been gestating in one form or another for over a decade. To illustrate the point, one of its songs is called How Long? and another is Wait for Me. The show began, more or less, in 2006 when Mitchell wrote a myth-based song cycle with folk, jazz and indie rhythms and toured it around Vermont in a school bus with an anarchist puppeteer on board. Those lo-fi performances became an album featuring Ani DiFranco and Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon and was a small sensation. In 2011, a producer suggested it could become a musical, and Mitchell, who wasn\u2019t a regular theatregoer, began to see as many musicals as she could, searching for the right collaborator. In 2013, she went to Ars Nova, the tiny theatre hosting Rachel Chavkin\u2019s dumpling-fuelled production of Dave Malloy\u2019s Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812, which would later come to Broadway. \u201cIt worked,\u201d Mitchell says, \u201con all my chakras.\u201d A few coffee dates and a five-hour Skype call later, Hadestown had its director. So yes, this is a story about Orpheus and Eurydice, about fate and love and death and snacks. But it\u2019s also a story about how two women \u2013 one of whom had never made theatre, the other who had come to musicals late and accidentally \u2013 have worked closely, fiercely and indefatigably to make a show that feels like something more intuitive, elemental, finely woven and seriously DIY than a traditional musical. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a classical musical,\u201d the National\u2019s artistic director Rufus Norris says, \u201cbut that\u2019s not what we want. We want the new thing that Rachel and Ana\u00efs are making together.\u201d Their collaboration has included preliminary workshops, an enthusiastically received run at the New York Theatre Workshop (The New York Times said: \u201cgorgeously sung\u201d), more workshops, another generally successful run at the Citadel theatre in Edmonton, Canada (The Globe and Mail: \u201cswings sublimely\u201d) then more workshops. After its three-month run at the National, the production, starring Reeve Carney and Patrick Page of Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark and Eva Noblezada of the recent Miss Saigon revival, will head to Broadway. Will that mean more tinkering, more gestating? \u201cOh yeah,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work on this thing until the moment it opens.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s like a pathological hunger for improvement,\u201d says Chavkin. That\u2019s fitting for a musical arguing that if everyone sings along, the world might change. Chavkin and Mitchell are speaking in Brooklyn, in the tiny office of Chavkin\u2019s company, which used to be called Theater of the Emerging American Moment, but now settles for the TEAM. That tiny office is made tinier by a jumble of wigs, action figures, guitars, a drum kit, a purple exercise ball and the Guerilla Girls\u2019 Advantages of Being a Woman Artist poster, but there is still room for a bottle of wine, a bag of popcorn and a box of chocolate-covered almonds. (Full disclosure: Mitchell and I live near each other in Brooklyn and our daughters both attend a weekly gym class called Ninja Training. More disclosure: I probably should have brought a second bottle of wine.) While a zumba class thrums next door, Mitchell and Chavkin discuss the winding road that has delivered the new musical out of the school bus and into a three-revolve rehearsal space at the National \u2013 \u201ca dream\u201d, Mitchell would write in an email two weeks later, \u201cwe feel so cared for\u201d \u2013 and how they\u2019ve kept their collaboration going for five years and counting. Karaoke helps. \u201cI think we\u2019ve definitely done like half of the Indigo Girls catalogue.\u201d Chavkin says. In 2013, when they began to work together, Chavkin\u2019s approach was fairly radical. \u201cI am most turned on by projects that are going to require my pretty deep investment,\u201d she says. Mitchell had been working on a libretto; Chavkin had her abandon it. Instead, they decided that the songs themselves would carry the story, helped along by passages of recitative, most of it chanted by the character of Hermes, the messenger god. The show would be all lyric, no prose, its spell unbroken. There was a moment when Mitchell quailed. She\u2019d already been working on the show for seven years. How much more could she do with it? Chavkin, who is big on eyeliner and tough love, told her: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a way to deal with your fatigue with this piece.\u201d Mitchell did. They worked together to understand the tension between songs, most of which Mitchell had written as a kind of sonic freeze frame \u2013 \u201ca dilation of an emotional moment\u201d \u2013 and scenes, which had to start the characters in one place and end them in another. There were new songs that fleshed out the story and new verses to help the old songs along. That was the version they brought to New York Theatre Workshop, in an immersive staging that drew performers and audience together under the same bare and spreading tree. That version, Chavkin felt, was still stuck somewhere between concept album and full dramatic event. For Edmonton, they added a male worker\u2019s chorus, retooled the set for a proscenium staging and made that set more luxurious. By the time the first preview arrived, Chavkin knew that had been a mistake. \u201cThe set was quite beautiful and it felt like the piece was dead,\u201d she says. \u201cIt stopped being a live, muscular music event and started becoming this well-behaved story musical which it never wanted to be.\u201d She cut three-quarters of that set between the first preview and the second. The show revived. That stripped-down design \u2013 \u201cGrecian amphitheatre meets Vermont barn\u201d \u2013 is the one they\u2019ll use in London. The choreography, by David Neumann, has also been enhanced, bringing, Chavkin says, a \u201cvisual lusciousness\u201d. Songs that Mitchell had left inviolate a dozen years, she has now broken open. \u201cI was like: How did this song never have a bridge before?\u201d she says. Orpheus\u2019s journey has different emphases and so does its destination. The show had never clarified the reasons that he turns around, abandoning Eurydice to the Underworld, but they are clearer now. \u201cThe revisions between Canada and London have just been explosive,\u201d Chavkin says. London is busy making its own revisions. The National\u2019s low-cost ticket initiatives skews the audience to a younger, more diverse one, mirrored in the casting of the chorus. When Mitchell first wrote Why We Build the Wall, which has been taken up as a protest anthem, the idea of a Trump presidency was ludicrous, unthinkable. That song has since become more literal, the shivers it induces more pointed. The dustbowl world of Hadestown has crept closer. Work continues. It will continue until the official opening night at the National. It will continue as the musical moves to Broadway, either this spring or next autumn. \u201cThe work is so fucking far from being done,\u201d Chavkin says. \u201cI would only ever say that if I thought the work was extraordinary. Because it\u2019s not worth revising crap, you know?\u201d Mitchell has been offered other musicals in the past year; she has turned them down for now. A couple of residencies this summer moved her to write some new, unrelated songs and she has begun to think about a new album and how comparatively easy it would be. \u201cOur vibe has also been Rachel kicking my ass for five years,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cBut it\u2019s been joyful.\u201d Hadestown is at the National Theatre, London, until 26 January.", "6||The reinvention of Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio and how Inter have found a new spiritJo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio sounded so certain. Interviewed by Gazzetta dello Sport at the start of June \u2013 just after he had completed a successful six-month loan at West Ham, and shortly before the start of a World Cup in which he would feature in all four matches played by Portugal \u2013 the midfielder insisted he would not return to Inter. \u201cI do not want to try again,\u201d he said of life at his parent club. \u201cI would not have the right motivation. That experience is over now. Zero doubts.\u201d You could understand the sentiment. Despite splashing out \u20ac40m to sign Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio in 2016, the Nerazzurri had never found him a steady role. Constant changes of manager during his first season with the club did not help but even Luciano Spalletti, after taking charge last summer, only gave him five starts in as many months before packing him off to the London Stadium. Inter were happy to grant the player\u2019s wish to be sold. The problem was finding a buyer. Sevilla were reported to have an interest but wound up taking Maxime Gonalons on loan from Roma instead. Their neighbours Real Betis, likewise, preferred Giovani Lo Celso. When more concrete offers arrived from Turkey, Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio turned them down. And so he stayed at Inter, a situation which seemed to please nobody. For the first two months of this season, he disappeared from view \u2013 popping up only for a Sky Sports interview in which he acknowledged supporters who jeered the reading out of his name among the subs before kickoff at San Siro. \u201cI think it\u2019s a body language problem,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery now and then it can seem like I\u2019m not present. That\u2019s a thing I need to improve.\u201d It is hard to prove much of anything, though, when you never set foot on the pitch. Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio did not get so much as a minute off the bench before suddenly being thrust into the starting XI for the visit to Lazio on 29 October. Fans and journalists scratched their heads. There had been little to indicate such a move was coming. But he played well, and Inter won 3-0. This was their eighth win in nine matches across all competitions, and easily the most convincing. Better was yet to follow against Genoa on Saturday. Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio started again, and had a hand in four out of five goals as Inter obliterated opponents who had drawn with Juventus last month. The opener ought not to have stood. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez\u2019s attempted through-pass for Roberto Gagliardini was blocked and ran to Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio. His initial control was clumsy, and he pulled out of a second touch as a pair of defenders closed in. This became an accidental dummy, all three players leaving the ball to run to Gagliardini, who had been in an offside position when it was last touched by his teammate. What came next was more impressive. Inter\u2019s second goal was glorious in its simplicity, the ball played out from defence to Marcelo Brozovic, who immediately squared it to Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio. He released Matteo Politano with a first-time 30-yard ball, and the latter finished coolly. Inter had gone from the edge of their own area to the back of the net in seven touches. Gazzetta called it \u201can anthem to vertical football\u201d. The hope in Milan is that it might prove a potent counter to the patient lateral movement of the Barcelona team they will face at San Siro on Tuesday. Spalletti\u2019s team were well beaten at the Camp Nou in their previous Champions League outing, yet these last two league games have offered encouraging signs. Inter are finally starting to look like the team that Spalletti has always wanted them to be: using aggression and physicality to dominate the pitch as well as the ball. A tactical shift has helped. With Radja Nainggolan sidelined by an ankle injury, Inter abandoned plans to play with a No 10, opting instead for a 4-3-3. The formation has offered Brozovic more support \u2013 giving him options when pressed, as he was on Politano\u2019s goal. It has seemed to suit the players alongside him \u2013 the extra cover allowing all midfielders to become runners, taking turns to get forward and break the lines. Gagliardini followed up that opening goal with another just after half-time. Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio, along with two assists, scored one of his own in injury time. So did Nainggolan, an 87th minute substitute. There was an awkward truth to confront here, in that neither Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio nor Gagliardini, Inter\u2019s two leading men on Saturday, will be available for selection against Bar\u00e7a. Both were excluded from Inter\u2019s Champions League squad, which has been restricted to 21 players as a result of their breach of Financial Fair Play regulations. How greatly they will be missed remains to be seen. Nainggolan\u2019s return is a boost, though it may tempt Spalletti to revert to his previous formation. That could be a mistake. Matias Vecino was rested against Genoa, but had been excellent against Lazio on the right of a midfield three. The specific terms of the FFP ruling, which limits Inter\u2019s ability to include new signings made during the assessed period of overspending, means that Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio and Gagliardini would likely remain excluded even if they do make it through to the Champions League knockout stage. Yet if there was another positive note for Spalletti this weekend then it was to be found in the collective spirit he can see developing. \u201cWe\u2019re Inter,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have all the right cards to give ourselves a chance.\u201d Spalletti will not have the full deck at his disposal, but Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio\u2019s re-emergence has shown us that he knows how to keep a trick or two up his sleeve. Talking points \u2022 Despite drawing with Juventus, Ivan Juric has not exactly hit the ground running since returning to the Genoa job \u2013 picking up two points from four games. Even more bothersome to the club\u2019s owner, Enrico Preziosi, might be the manager\u2019s decision to start with Serie A\u2019s top scorer, Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek, on the bench and deny him a spot in the shop window at San Siro. \u2022 Even Franco Baresi was moved to tweet after Alessio Romagnoli scored his second injury-time winner for Milan in as many games. But the real story here was that the Rossoneri kept their first clean sheet since April. \u2022 Juventus made it 31 points from 11 games \u2013 the best start in club history. They weren\u2019t great against Cagliari and it is reasonable to ask questions about just how solid the champions are at the back. Four clean sheets in 11 games is underwhelming. \u2022 A rampant win for Napoli over Empoli, and a hat-trick for Dries Mertens. He is now Serie A\u2019s most prolific Belgian ever. \u2022 Three games in charge of Chievo now for former Italy manager Gian Piero Ventura, and three defeats. Aggregate score: 9-2.", "8||Trump\u2019s sanctions against Iran help the US\u2019s enemies and weaken its friendsEconomic sanctions are state aggression. As of today, those imposed by the US against Iran are broadened to embrace any country, company or individual dealing with Tehran. A few lucky \u201cfriends\u201d of Donald Trump \u2013 China, India, Iraq, Turkey, Korea \u2013 may escape. The EU has also promised to help companies that resist, but that may not count for much. Almost every international corporation does some business with the US. Trump\u2019s edict that his enemy\u2019s friend is his enemy is a declaration of war on his friends. It is hard to think of a good reason for this action. Economic sanctions are the ultimate soft power, virtue signalling by rich states against poor ones. They supposedly work by inducing an impoverished populace to rise up and demand their government surrender. They never do, because sanctioned regimes tend by definition to be repressive. Sanctions mostly strengthen and embattle those in power \u2013 North Korea, Cuba and Iran being cases in point. Sanctions against Russia over Crimea have been utterly pointless. Ironically Iran is one of the few places where sanctions may have had some \u2013 limited \u2013 effect, in edging Tehran towards the 2015 nuclear treaty with President Obama. That was largely because Iran retained elements of democratic accountability. That accountability must have evaporated in the US\u2019s breach of faith. There is no evidence that Iran has reneged on its treaty undertakings. Trump protests at Iran\u2019s support for \u201cbad guys\u201d across the Middle East. But that was not in the treaty, nor should it be the west\u2019s business. The US\u2019s unilateral breach of the deal is not just an offence against international order, and probably law. By extending the sanctions to his allies, Trump has broken faith with them too. More serious, the sanctions will strengthen Tehran\u2019s anti-democratic military and religious centres of power against the more liberal commercial ones. This will drive Iran further towards Russia and towards involvement in the region\u2019s Islamist conflicts. To reactionaries, Trump is a dream American, a stupid and a belligerent one. Economic war weakens the poor and the middle class, and strengthens autocracy. Because it is \u201cnon-violent\u201d and largely cost-free to the aggressor, it precipitates no crisis and no pressure for resolution. The conflict just drags on, widening the gap between rich and poor states. Sanctions are the bluntest weapon in the foreign policy armoury. The hope now must be that after this week\u2019s congressional election, Trump will seek some deal with the ayatollahs that he can label a victory, Korea-style. If so, bring it on. For the time being, the US president is harming his allies and aiding his enemies. He is destabilising the Middle East and aggravating his wider campaign against global free trade. There is nothing good in it. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist", "25||'The wrong type of development': the battle for Edinburgh's Leith WalkLike most ports, Leith has always been a place of change \u2013 and never more so than over the last 25 years. By the mid-1990s Edinburgh\u2019s ancient dock district had become infamous as the grim, drug-addled backdrop to Trainspotting. However, a sustained period of redevelopment followed, and the cleaned-up streets are now home to Michelin-starred restaurants and hipster bars. Leith is regularly included in lists of the world\u2019s coolest neighbourhoods \u2013 how Renton, Begbie, Spud et al would have laughed. Not all the rough edges of this historically deprived neighbourhood have been lost to gentrification. It was its longstanding working-class and artist communities that provided the impetus for the recent rebirth of the Leith theatre after 30 years of neglect, much to the delight of just about everyone in Edinburgh. Another proposed development has not received such universal support, however. Drum Property Group\u2019s \u00a350m plan to develop a 1.2-hectare (three-acre) site on Leith Walk \u2013 the main artery between the city centre and the port \u2013 into a 520-bed student accommodation complex with hotel, restaurant, retail units and 50 \u201caffordable\u201d homes is proving hugely controversial. On the surface, it\u2019s the developer\u2019s intention to demolish a parade of 1920s shops that has angered many locals. But go deeper and there are more complex concerns at play, including the area\u2019s lack of affordable housing, the proliferation of short-term lets and a planning system that is accused of favouring profit over people. Few in Leith would argue that the site in question, part of which has lain derelict for years, doesn\u2019t require attention. But the loss of 106 to 154 Leith Walk, a row of sandstone art deco shops, businesses and social enterprises (including a thriving live-music venue, Leith Depot, and a recording studio) is the wrong type of development, say campaigners. Among them is Trainspotting author and native Leither Irvine Welsh, who now lives in Chicago. He says the area is at risk of being \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d if working-class people and artists are forced out by \u201csterile\u201d developments. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a number of local SNP and Green politicians, and local heroes the Proclaimers have also voiced opposition to the proposal. Ian Hood, who has lived in the area since 1986, says he set up the Save Leith Walk campaign to celebrate \u201cthe essence of what Leith is\u201d by protecting the diversity as well as the heritage of the street, which has existed since the mid-1600s. \u201cThe row of shops they want to demolish means different things to different people,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a place to work, a local landmark, a place to shop, party and meet friends. Most importantly of all it is a place that is worth keeping. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to preserve this building in aspic, we want it to be a living building that develops and progresses along with the rest of Leith Walk. With a bit of investment this block could be home to new shops and businesses that provide economic opportunities at the heart of our community.\u201d The average house price in Edinburgh is \u00a3270,000, twice the Scottish average, while monthly rents in the city now average \u00a31,100. According to the council, Edinburgh, which has a population of 500,000, has a concentration of Airbnb listings that is four times greater than London or Paris, and eight times greater than New York \u2013 one for every 54 residents. Leith is at the heart of this boom, and proved the most popular destination for short-term lets during this year\u2019s international and fringe festivals. Accusations that the short-term letting sector deprives local communities of housing while contributing little to services and infrastructure have prompted City of Edinburgh Council to lobby Airbnb to cap the number of properties it allows in the city. With regard to student lets, meanwhile, Leith already has two big purpose-built sites. \u201cUltimately, Leith needs long-term social and council housing that will help create a diverse community,\u201d adds Hood. \u201cSo-called affordable housing too often turns out to be unaffordable. \u201cWe also need to give opportunities to people who live here. We need jobs that pay more than the minimum wage. Behind the shops they want to knock down there are 3,500 square metres of space that could be used for social housing and small business units. \u201cThe existing shops are small with cheap rents, which allows people to take a risk. For some, that will pay off and the whole community benefits as a result. It\u2019s not that we are against progress. But the demolition of this building would be a sign that Leith has been sold to the highest bidder.\u201d Following a slew of public meetings, a petition containing more than 12,300 signatures was handed into City of Edinburgh council at the end of August opposing the plan, while more than 3,500 objections were lodged as part of a public consultation that closed in early October. Not surprisingly, Drum Property Group \u2013 which paid more than \u00a34m for the site \u2013 views the situation very differently. The firm describes the opposition campaign as \u201caggressive\u201d, accusing protesters of deliberately focusing on the demolition of the shops without recognising the plan for the whole site, which it insists will deliver an array of benefits to the community. The company points to more than 2,000 letters submitted in support of its proposal, and says some of the existing tenants in the block \u2013 including social enterprise community cafe Punjabi Junction \u2013 have agreed to take space in the new building. \u201cThis shows there is a significant appetite among local people and businesses welcoming change for this important part of Leith Walk,\u201d says Graeme Bone, managing director of Drum Property Group. \u201cWe have recently witnessed a very aggressive and high-profile campaign of opposition to our plans. \u201cThe conversations we have been having with local people tell us something different \u2013 that this area has been neglected and desperately needs new investment to create a welcoming, distinctive and accessible destination linked to the rest of the city. It is clear that the existing buildings are no longer an economically viable investment.\u201d No date has been set for a final decision. Leith Walk isn\u2019t the only controversial development doing the rounds in Edinburgh, of course. Another group of writers that includes Ian Rankin and Alexander McCall Smith recently accused the council of \u201casset stripping\u201d and betraying future generations, following a decision to allow Sir Richard Branson to build a hotel next to the capital\u2019s historic Central Library on George IV Bridge. And a public inquiry is ongoing to determine the future of another of the city\u2019s historic buildings, the vacant Royal high school on Calton Hill. Meanwhile, a luxury hotel dubbed \u201cthe Turd\u201d by critics has already been given planning permission at the revamped St James Centre. Green MSP Andy Wightman, a long-time campaigner on land reform, believes all these developments raise questions about the poor state of the planning system in Scotland and beyond. \u201cWith regard to Leith Walk, the company owns the site and expects to make a return,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s fundamentally not what the planning system should be about. We should start by considering what the best use for a piece of land is \u2013 we don\u2019t currently do that. \u201cWhat is coming out of the Save Leith Walk campaign reflects the wider frustration when a community doesn\u2019t feel it has any influence on the changes happening around them. We can also see that in the way the trams were handled in Edinburgh [the infamous project ended up \u00a3375m overbudget and three years late] to short-term lets, to lack of affordable housing.\u201d Wightman has been pressing the Scottish government to make the \u201cmediocre\u201d planning bill currently going through the Scottish parliament more robust and responsive to the needs of communities. But he\u2019s not holding his breath, believing it will take \u201ctime, resources and more confidence\u201d to fundamentally change a planning system he believes is not fit for purpose. \u201cIt is 70 years old and driven by private interests,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m trying to turn that round to have a more upfront system with more community participation around how land is allocated and used. I don\u2019t think the current bill delivers that. \u201cCommunities should have the right to appeal as well as applicants. We also want to see a more European model with specific zoning, so you know where you can and can\u2019t put and do certain things. \u201cCommunities need to own more land to exercise control over their environment.

If you\u2019d like to receive this briefing by email, sign up here. Top story: midterms become a tale of two presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama took to the campaign trail on Sunday, both making a final bid to convince midterms voters that theirs is the more compelling vision of America. For Trump, stumping in Georgia, that vision was a fearful one, of a nation overrun by \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d and \u201cpredators\u201d should Democrats regain power. Speaking at a rally in Indiana, Obama urged a turn away from Trump\u2019s divisive and dishonest politics, driven by \u201cblatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly lying\u201d. Romney\u2019s return. Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential rival Mitt Romney is on the brink of reaching Washington as the new US senator from Utah. Will he make life difficult for Trump? Marijuana map.

Rouhani says new US sanctions put Iran in a \u2018war situation\u2019 Iran has launched air defence drills in response to the reimposition of US sanctions, with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, saying the country now faces \u201ca war situation\u201d. The new sanctions took effect on Monday, timed to coincide with the anniversary of the start of the Iran hostage crisis in 1979. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said the sanctions \u2013 focused on oil, shipping and banking \u2013 would not hurt the Iranian people. No deal. The sanctions, which place an embargo on oil and seek to cut off Iran\u2019s banking sector from global markets, are the most punitive measures imposed by Washington since the Trump administration withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Kobach took donations from white nationalist sympathisers Kris Kobach, the Republican candidate for governor of Kansas and a close ally of Trump, has accepted thousands of dollars in donations and longstanding support from white nationalist sympathisers and groups espousing white supremacist views, according to recent financial disclosures. Kobach, currently the Kansas secretary of state, is best known for his commitment to harsh voter ID laws that critics say are aimed at suppressing the political power of minority voters. Dodge City. Kobach\u2019s gubernatorial race against Democrat Laura Kelly grew more controversial last week as it emerged the sole polling place in Dodge City, Kansas, was to be moved from the city centre, drawing criticism from the ACLU and others. Xi Jinping promises greater openness amid US-China trade war The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has vowed to lower import tariffs and increase access to the Chinese market, in comments apparently depicting his country as a champion of globalisation, with fears growing for the Chinese economy amid its trade war with the US. Speaking at a trade fair in Shanghai on Monday, Xi insisted: \u201cChina will not close its door to the world and will only become more and more open.\u201d Human rights review. China\u2019s human rights record will be examined by the UN on Tuesday, under a process known as the \u201cuniversal periodic review\u201d, focusing on Beijing\u2019s treatment of ethnic minorities, detention of activists and suppression of religious and civil freedoms.

Seven ways to address your insomnia Finding it hard to sleep at night? It could be the midterms, or it could just be the coffee. Joanna Moorhead suggests seven ways to combat insomnia, from watching your diet to keeping a sleep diary. The swanky Rio restaurant that serves the homeless Rio\u2019s chic Refettorio Gastromotiva restaurant serves food donated by companies that would otherwise throw it away, prepared by trainee chefs from favelas and other low-income communities. Its diners are the local homeless, who eat there for free. Dom Phillips reports. Opinion The midterms are a referendum on the sitting president, writes Allan J Lichtman. So this week\u2019s result will rest on which emotion proves more powerful in driving turnout: love or hate of Donald Trump. Two-thirds of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll taken in late October said that Trump will be a factor in their midterm votes \u2026 A similar poll taken before the midterm elections of 2014 found that then president Barack Obama would be either a minor or a major factor in voting for only 47% of respondents.

There\u2019s no band, no instruments, just a woman singing about love, ennui and Milton Friedman. \u201cIf people are provoked by seeing a person on stage singing, that\u2019s good,\u201d she audibly shrugs down the line from her home in Berlin. \u201cI think it\u2019s punk. It\u2019s not about skill, it\u2019s the fact that you are human, on a stage where everything is focused on you and your expression. And that has all the value in the world.\u201d Her stark, mesmerising stage show is a neat visual representation of Nilsson Industries: she is a completely one-woman outfit, producing and performing all her music solo, booking her own tours, and releasing her own albums (this last task admittedly in tandem with indie Glasgow label Night School Records). Her debut came in 2008, and a decade later \u2013 following her masterpiece Imaginations, one of the best records of last year \u2013 she\u2019s just released her eighth, the similarly excellent Twenty Twenty. Is 10 years a long time to spend by oneself? \u201cI know that a lot of people are afraid of loneliness, and I don\u2019t understand, because it\u2019s nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you genuinely feel lonely, you can look at the situation and say: What if I just turn this around, and this is nice? And what if I\u2019m just there for myself instead?\u201d For Nilsson, solitude is spiritually enriching. \u201cI\u2019m on the train and see people on their phones, and I wonder what they\u2019re doing, and I wish they were writing a poem, and I look over and it\u2019s just colourful candies \u2013 they\u2019re playing a game. It\u2019s OK, you\u2019re on your way home from work, killing time. But why kill the time? I don\u2019t mean that everything has to be meaningful \u2013 sitting and staring is maybe not meaningful, but it\u2019s very necessary for our brains to recover, and to daydream. I think that\u2019s why I became a songwriter: it enabled me to do what I love the most, which is daydreaming.\u201d But solitude is also political. \u201cA lot of the taboo of loneliness is that when you\u2019re by yourself, you might not be as productive,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom early childhood, we\u2019re raised to always do something that results in something. We\u2019re deprived of a lot of dreaming. Because that space is always filled up \u2013 think of the speed of news and how we don\u2019t really get to digest things.\u201d Nilsson\u2019s songs often comment on capital, be it trickle-down economics, the American dream, or the sheer indomitable power of finance (\u201cYou keep waking up a mess / But money\u2019s already dressed\u201d). Her daydreaming, then, seems to be a way to exist outside of the channels that capital sends us down; a mental agility that also allows her to see loneliness as joy, or the banal as magical. \u201cI do a lot of exercises where I try to inject a lot of supernatural events into my life that might not really be there \u2013 I charge things up so they become really meaningful to me,\u201d she explains. \u201cEvery day can\u2019t go around being special, you\u2019ve got to give it some help. Even the way I prepare breakfast.\u201d She gives the example of lighting incense before I called her. \u201cI thought it would be cool if there was a smell. But the incense was very strong and it was quite uncomfortable, so I had to open the window and air it out. That was a failed attempt. But I like the idea of curating everything around me \u2013 it\u2019s not just me sitting down writing a song that makes me an artist. I\u2019d like to think I can also write a breakfast, and the breakfast is like a song.\u201d Incense cleared, she reverts to smoking: the flinty rush of a lighter can be heard numerous times during our conversation. \u201cAm I smoking because it makes me feel I\u2019m doing the thing I shouldn\u2019t be doing, and that makes me feel free? Or am I smoking because I\u2019m addicted to it, and I\u2019m not free?\u201d So which is it? \u201cI think I\u2019m addicted. But I would like to be able to escape everything.\u201d All this imagination and self-direction all dates back to a childhood in Sweden, where she had to fight for attention. \u201cI felt like no one would listen to me. In high school, we were 28 girls and three boys, and I felt those three boys got more attention than all the other girls. I struggled to find female voices that were relatable, and that were singing about today. I felt like: I\u2019ll do it myself then.\u201d Of course, relatability is now the chief currency in pop music, all earnest emotional articulacy and you-do-you affirmations. \u201cEvery song on the radio is about waiting for your Uber driver, but this was not the case 12 years ago.\u201d Initially expending her creative energy on comics and writing, she started playing around on a flatmate\u2019s keyboard. \u201cThere were endless possibilities \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem that there was anything I couldn\u2019t write a song about.\u201d She moved to Berlin, working in the cloakroom of the bacchanalian superclub Berghain \u2013 an apt role for this solo observer \u2013 and made enough money each weekend to focus on music on the weekdays, before she quit altogether after her music started taking her around the world. For all her musing on the cruelty of capital, her determination and deadpan whimsy mark her out as an optimist: she wanted Twenty Twenty to be \u201ca friend that you could turn to\u201d, and its very title is meant to be hopeful. \u201cThere\u2019s something very exciting with a new decade,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the numbers are so round and inviting \u2013 there\u2019s so much promise. It\u2019s like Earth has a birthday and we\u2019re all sharing it together. Birthdays I don\u2019t like so much, they\u2019re so focused on one life and there\u2019s this strange pressure: oh, I\u2019m getting older. But New Year\u2019s has none of that, because we\u2019re getting older together.\u201d She warms to her theme. \u201cI love New Year\u2019s. I don\u2019t think of New Year\u2019s parties, or trying to find someone to kiss at 12 o\u2019clock; I love the idea that there\u2019s this night where everything is new. You could quit smoking and go to the gym and speak to your family more. And everything will be better. You can be cynical and go: yeah, but one week later you\u2019ve got a hamburger on the sofa, and you\u2019re smoking again. But with this record, I didn\u2019t want to focus on 8 January, I wanted to focus on 31 December.\u201d Her big-hearted outlook is infectious \u2013 after our conversation I skip back to my desk like Fred Astaire. Few other solo musicians are so aware of their own ego, desire and capabilities, and so able to pick these qualities up and ponder them. On the one hand, she knows she\u2019s good: \u201cIf I got a job at a bakery, I\u2019m not sure my bread would be as good as my songs. If we all do the thing we feel we are the best at, then that\u2019s a positive thing for everyone.\u201d But equally, she knows she could still look at the world from even more obtuse angles. \u201cI\u2019m always trying to teach my brain new ways of thinking, and so right now I would like to get better at steering the mind car. I\u2019m still learning to drive.\u201d So she\u2019s currently in the back seat, still being driven by her mind? I\u2019m sure can hear a wry smile. She replies: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m a passenger, picking the music. But eventually I\u2019ll have to get into the driving seat.\u201d \u2022 Twenty Twenty is out now on Night School Records/Dark Skies Association.", "10||Antisemitism row: Ukip accused over links with US far-right websiteJewish organisations have accused Ukip of embracing antisemitic conspiracy theories through the party\u2019s links to a far-right US website that regularly attacks George Soros and has argued that the Pittsburgh synagogue attack could have been instigated by the US government. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Community Security Trust (CST) has called on Ukip to dissociate itself from Infowarsafter it brought in one of the website\u2019s editors as a member and used him to promote the party to younger people. John Mann, the Labour MP who chairs the all-party parliamentary group against antisemitism, said Infowars was a \u201cvile and dangerous\u201d organisation. It is led by Alex Jones, a web radio host who argues the 9/11 attacks, the 7 July bombings in London and the Sandy Hook primary school massacre were either faked or carried out by government-linked forces. Jones is being sued by Sandy Hook parents and has been banned from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. His de facto deputy at Infowars is Paul Joseph Watson, a Briton who has the title of \u201ceditor at large\u201d for the website, and has regularly guested on Jones\u2019s show. In June, Watson was among a trio of YouTube personalities welcomed into Ukip as part of an attempt by its leader, Gerard Batten, to make the party more appealing to young voters. Another was Mark Meechan, a self-described comedian and free speech activist who was fined this year for posting a video showing his girlfriend\u2019s dog giving Nazi salutes in response to phrases including \u201cgas the Jews\u201d. Watson\u2019s membership was seen as a particular coup \u2013 he has 1.4 million YouTube subscribers \u2013 and after he joined, a video he made praising the party was featured prominently on Ukip\u2019s website. The association with Infowars has prompted renewed concerns about the direction of a party that remains the UK\u2019s fourth-biggest by polling numbers, but under Batten has taken a more hard-right stance, mainly targeting Islam. Infowars regularly carries disparaging stories about the supposed influence of Soros, the billionaire financier who is at the centre of antisemitic conspiracies about so-called \u201cglobalists\u201d seeking to control the world. Separately, Soros was among 14 prominent US figures to whom pipe bombs were posted this month. Jones has argued the bombs were a \u201cfalse flag\u201d plot. In a broadcast after the Pittsburgh shooting last month, in which 11 worshippers were killed, he said the attack could have been instigated by \u201cthe deep state\u201d. The government could have been \u201cplanning with groups they control to stage terror attacks\u201d before the US midterm elections, he said. Robert Bowers, the alleged gunman in Pittsburgh, made online posts about what he said was the Jewish control of the American government. Jones and Watson insist they are not antisemitic, and Watson has not publicly endorsed many of Jones\u2019s more lurid conspiracy theories. But the Jewish groups said they were alarmed that Ukip should ally itself with the website. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies said it was very concerned at the party\u2019s association with people \u201cpropagating conspiracy theories and dogwhistle antisemitism\u201d. He said: \u201cWe call on the party leadership to publicly and unequivocally disassociate themselves from these views and to expel any members who are found to hold them.\u201d A spokesman for the CST, which works against antisemitism in the UK, said: \u201cThe seepage of antisemitism and conspiracy theories into mainstream politics encourages hatred and undermines democracy. Rather than shunning these dangers, Ukip appears to be embracing them; and in the process is losing any claim it once had to be a respectable, mainstream party.\u201d Mann said: \u201cIn a climate of political uncertainty, conspiracy theories have been rising in popularity. Infowars is notorious for its part in feeding such conspiracies and at the root of many, if not all, of these myths is a hatred and suspicion of Jews. \u201cAny party serious about tackling antisemitism and racism would do well to cut all ties with infowars.\u201d A Ukip spokesman said: \u201cMr Watson is frequently the subject of attacks by actual antisemites because of his vociferous support for Israel. He is no more responsible for the comments of Alex Jones than Andrew Neil is for the comments of the director general of the BBC. \u201cThis line of questioning, built on cynical supposition and innuendo, is a clumsy attempt to smear Mr Watson and Ukip for political gain. To comment any further would give it a credibility it does not deserve.\u201d", "26||More than a meal: the swanky Rio restaurant for homeless peopleIn a chic, minimalist restaurant with an Italian name and an innovative menu, near the centre of Rio de Janeiro, Valdicir dos Santos tucks into his dinner. It consists of banana skin and vegetables served with tangerine sauce, beans, rice and farinha \u2013 the flour, ground from dried bread instead of the usual manioc, that Brazilians sprinkle on everything. The food at Refettorio Gastromotiva is excellent \u2013 and Dos Santos is one of 90 people eating here for free. \u201cI\u2019m a regular,\u201d says Dos Santos, a homeless man, who has a salad to start and banana ice cream, strawberries and granola for dessert. \u201cIt\u2019s a real find, because the food is well selected.\u201d Refettorio Gastromotiva, which opened in August 2016, just before the Olympic Games, is a unique project in a city blighted by poverty and rising homelessness. Those who eat here \u2013 abandoned by a country where inequality runs deep and the economy is still crawling out of a crippling recession \u2013 say its meals offer a rare moment of humanity. The restaurant\u2019s food is donated by companies that would otherwise throw it away, and prepared by a team of trainees led by professional chefs. They are adept at turning what would otherwise be waste into appetising menus. The diners, who are served the food by volunteers, are selected by different non-profit groups. Dos Santos was invited by a charity working with the homeless; other diners are immigrants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Most of the team cooking here are from favelas and low-income communities. All negotiated a tough selection process to claim a place on a three-month training course leading to a diploma. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have a diploma or specialisation, you can\u2019t move forward in life,\u201d says L\u00e9a Dami\u00e3o, 38, a trainee and mother of three from Rio\u2019s Vig\u00e1rio Geral favela, as she helps to prepare tonight\u2019s meal. She worked as a manicurist for 16 years, but always loved cooking. \u201cI want to be a chef one day,\u201d she says. Dami\u00e3o fell \u201cin love\u201d with the work at Gastromotiva, which pays her travel and also covers her meals at work. She has since finished the training, but comes back every week to volunteer. \u201cThe course was totally free and I think I owe something,\u201d she says. Gastromotiva\u2019s co-founder, Brazilian chef David Hertz, 44, says the concept, called \u201csocial gastronomy\u201d, is growing worldwide. He travels incessantly, looking at new initiatives. \u201cFor us, fighting food waste is a way of generating meals for people who need them, people in need,\u201d he says. \u201cGastronomy for us is the means, not the end. It is a means for social inclusion.\u201d Born in Curitiba, in southern Brazil, Hertz travelled for seven years before moving back to Brazil and studying gastronomy. He became a chef at Santo Gr\u00e3o, an upscale restaurant in S\u00e3o Paulo city. But his view of cooking was transformed in 2004, when he visited a kitchen in a favela in the city\u2019s gritty, low-income suburbs \u2013 the periferia. \u201cIt was my first time in a favela,\u201d he says, \u201cand what I saw that day would transform my life forever.\u201d Hertz launched a project called Cozinheiro Cidad\u00e3o, or \u201cCitizen Cook\u201d, to train people from disadvantaged neighbourhoods, and developed the project into Gastromotiva. By 2013, the word \u201csocial gastronomy\u201d was being used to other similar initiatives, such as his friend Jamie Oliver\u2019s Fifteen restaurant, which trains chefs from underprivileged backgrounds, and San Francisco\u2019s La Cocina, which according to its mission statement \u201ccultivates low income food entrepreneurs\u201d. Five years ago, Gastromotiva moved to Rio. It has since opened cooking schools in partnership with universities for underprivileged youth in Curitiba, Mexico, El Salvador and South Africa. About 70-80% (approximately 4,500 people) of those who have trained at Gastromotiva projects have since found full-time work, says communication and marketing director Mariana Vilhena. In 2015, Italian chef Massimo Bottura \u2013 a close friend of Hertz\u2019s who was later named the world\u2019s best chef \u2013 opened Refettorio, a restaurant serving the homeless in the impoverished Geco district of Rome. Together with his wife, Lara Gilmore, Bottura later launched Food for Soul, which aims to \u201cfight food waste through social inclusion\u201d. The organisation has since opened canteens in Paris and London. In 2016, just before the Olympic Games, Bottura and Hertz teamed up with journalist Ale Forbes to open Refettorio Gastromotiva in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Lapa area, where homeless people congregate and many sell second-hand goods on blankets spread out on the sidewalk. Inside the canteen, three immigrants from the DRC are dining. Paulo Mbengi, 37, fled hunger and war at home two years ago and came to Brazil as a refugee, but he has not been able to find work and lives in a distant Rio favela. \u201cBrazil does not give assistance to our people,\u201d he says. Refettorio Gastromotiva is the exception. \u201cThe food is good here,\u201d says Mbengi. \u201cI will come back.\u201d Pedro de Souza, 50, a formerly homeless man also enjoying a meal, says Refettorio Gastromotiva offers vulnerable people like him more than just a good meal. \u201cYou eat new things, new menus. It\u2019s a new way to be served. You interact with other people. There is a whole sociability in the project,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t just socialise the homeless, they humanise us.\u201d", "27||Crossword roundup: duffel coats, knapsacks, duffel bags and backpacksThe news in clues As the US recalls that even Ronald \u201cstrapping young buck\u201d Reagan could manage these kind of words \u2026 \u2026 Anto in the Guardian\u2019s quiptic recalls a dusty expression: 14ac Reagan let IRS shake up old currency group (8,4) [wordplay: anagram (\u201cshake up\u201d) REAGANLETIRS] [definition: old currency group] It is not REAGANOMICS or STAR WARS, as \u201cReagan\u201d is merely part of the anagram; it is a term that brings to mind either Britain \u201cinvisible empire\u201d after the second world war or that long-ago period before the Scotland and Europe referendums: the STERLING AREA.

What makes this so impressive is that all these men and women have Parkinson\u2019s disease. The members of Lancaster PD Flow and Connect class catch each other\u2019s eyes and grin. It\u2019s taken about 30 minutes, but they have a control over their bodies they did not have when they arrived at this room at St John\u2019s Hospice on the edge of Lancaster. At this moment they are simply dancers. \u201cI think we have got that off to a tee,\u201d says Brierley, radiating satisfaction. \u201cI am quite proud of that. Think of a body that can shift and change. If you are finding things difficult today, don\u2019t beat yourself up.\u201d Her enthusiasm is infectious. \u201cI am trying to help people to remind the link with their own bodies,\u201d she beams. She has been working with Parkinson\u2019s patients for 10 years and was awarded a Churchill Fellowship in 2014 to study dance and the disease in the US for her PhD at Roehampton University. There is growing appetite for dance among the 145,000 people in the UK with Parkinson\u2019s, the degenerative neurological disease that freezes, weakens and removes control over muscles. Three years ago, the Dance for Parkinson\u2019s Partnership listed 20 UK classes but now there are about 70. English National Ballet has been running a Parkinson\u2019s programme for 10 years and has hubs in Ipswich, Oxford, Cardiff, Liverpool and London. Initial research with Dr Sara Houston from the University of Roehampton showed a series of 12 weekly dance classes improved balance and stability. And a new study led by Dr Judith Bek at Manchester University\u2019s Body, Eyes and Movement Laboratories suggests dance classes can help people with Parkinson\u2019s to tackle everyday domestic tasks more effectively. Her project \u2013 collaborating with ENB, Manchester Metropolitan University and dance social enterprise Equilibrium \u2013 used ballet and classical Indian dance. Some participants reported that Indian hand gestures had allowed them to do previously impossible practical tasks, such as opening jars and reaching for objects. Bek is excited. \u201cImagine what a big selling point it would be with NHS and social care services if we could could prove that dance helps daily activity,\u201d she says. Brierley\u2019s regulars are clear that it works. As the class ends, former primary school teacher and guitarist Mike Bell, 69, admits he is feeling exhilarated after romping his way through Brierley\u2019s version of a Scottish reel. \u201cI really feel the benefit of dance the day after,\u201d says Bell, who was diagnosed two years ago. \u201cOn those days I feel completely normal and can walk around, do jobs around the house and play my guitar. Otherwise I just sit around and it\u2019s easy to feel miserable.\u201d It is more than just exercise, according to former merchant navy man Bob Hay, 75, who initially resisted going to Brierley\u2019s class. Now he\u2019s working with her to make a film to raise the profile of dance for people like himself. \u201cI was in a very black place mentally when I came here, but dance keeps me alive,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thing with dance is that it makes you think too. The more I can keep active and fit, the longer I will live with the disease.\u201d Whether it is ballet, contemporary or traditional Indian dance, classes appear to have similar effects. Participants at Brierley\u2019s class arrive hesitantly \u2013 several supported by sticks and walking frames \u2013 but they leave after an hour\u2019s s journey through movement feeling better. All are moving more fluently, one woman who arrived in a wheelchair leaves the room pushing it and all are laughing and joking. Houston\u2019s research with ENB found that dance combats depression, which affects 40% of people with Parkinson\u2019s, and social isolation. \u201cDance keeps people physically and socially active which prevents them from feeling disabled,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of these people feel socially isolated.\u201d The issue of proof is a crucial one, says Kiki Gale, the director of Dance for Parkinson\u2019s Partnership, who is organising an international symposium at Sadler\u2019s Wells next March to share research findings and pinpoint dance\u2019s value over physiotherapy or other forms of exercise. It is hoped that health and social care professionals will be among the delegates. \u201cWhen you walk into a PD dance class you see the magic\u201d, says Gale, \u201cbut how can we get the health professionals into the room to see that?\u201d In Bristol, Rachael James has been running a Parkinson\u2019s dance class at Southmead hospital funded by Fresh Arts, an arts programme managed by North Bristol NHS trust, and Bristol city council is funding her to do a new weekly class. For Donna Baber, arts programme manager for North Bristol NHS trust, it makes economic sense. She says: \u201cIf people are better able to manage their conditions, they are less likely to require our services.\u201d", "8||Andrew Marr\u2019s handling of Arron Banks was pathetic \u2013 and damagingAmong his many skills and talents, Andrew Marr does not count that of forensic accounting. That was obvious \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 to anyone watching his interview with Brexit financier Arron Banks. As predicted by myself, by Carole Cadwalladr and by many others the interview failed to land a punch. Instead, it provided Banks with a platform from which to attack his accusers and muddy the waters. This was not public interest journalism, it was carnival. And it did a great deal of damage. There are those who find such criticism of the BBC, and of its editorial decisions, distasteful. \u201cCareful, Andrew,\u201d they say to me, even as more often than not they agree with the substance of my case, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to damage Auntie, we could end up with the Beeb being run by Murdoch!\u201d Well I certainly want no such thing. But recently, and particularly on the issues surrounding Brexit, it has frankly been hard to see what difference it would make. The Banks broadcast is far from being an anomaly. The BBC is consistently manipulated by Brexiteers into providing them with false parity in arguments where their views add nothing, represent nobody and are demonstrably and factually wrong. Nigel Farage \u2013 the former leader of a party that polls in single figures and has no MPs \u2013 has appeared on Question Time disproportionately often. Brexit campaigners are paraded constantly across the airwaves to spout nonsense and lies about the single market, the customs union and \u2013 most unforgivably \u2013 the Irish border. Day after day BBC Radio\u2019s flagship show \u2013 Today \u2013 descends into surrealist farce as John Humphrys seems to bark inanities at anyone presenting an evidenced argument against Brexit. On top of these errors \u2013 made by taking the name of balance in vain and not unlike the practice of inviting climate-change sceptics to debate Nobel-winning scientists \u2013 is the BBC\u2019s institutional determination to declare the existential questions of Brexit answered. The BBC political editor\u2019s immediate reaction to an investigation into allegations of criminal offences by Banks \u2013 which he denies\u2013 was to write that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d to affect Brexit. A tad premature, to say the least. And it is because of this instinct \u2013 to get it \u201cover and done with\u201d \u2013 that the BBC has so consistently failed in its coverage of the campaign for a people\u2019s vote. Farage gets more coverage for a stunt throwing fish out of a boat \u2013 accompanied by a couple of fishermen and an entire school of journalists \u2013 than the People\u2019s Vote campaign does for any of our many regional events and action days that attract volunteers in their hundreds. These blind spots are undermining the BBC as an institution. They have deformed its news output and led to catastrophically bad decisions \u2013 which have normalised fringe politics and given false weight to outright lies. I don\u2019t criticise the BBC lightly or with any joy. I do so because it is getting it badly wrong \u2013 for itself and for us all. If the BBC expects to continue to enjoy public funds and public trust it needs \u2013 urgently \u2013 to examine its conscience and its output. It is not \u201cbalance\u201d to invite contributors to mislead your audience. It isn\u2019t \u201cpublic interest journalism\u201d to offer Banks a platform to attack his accusers and investigators. And it is not the responsibility of progressives and liberals to keep quiet in the face of such terrible judgment \u2013 either out of loyalty or from fear of what might replace the beloved BBC. It is our job to call it out. \u2022 Andrew Adonis is a Labour peer", "2||America's marijuana map: how things might change after the midterms", "8||The midterm results will reveal what drives voters: a love or hate of TrumpDonald Trump was right when he said that America\u2019s midterm elections will be about him. Midterm elections are always to some degree a referendum on the incumbent president, and Trump is the most polarizing president in the modern history of the United States. He has inspired a fervent following and an equally passionate opposition. The midterm results will depend on what drives more turnout this year \u2013 love or hate of Trump. For Trump\u2019s backers, he is a true populist who has toppled a crooked political establishment that pursued its own interests at the expense of ordinary Americans. He created a booming economy, cut taxes, unshackled enterprise from stifling regulations, and renegotiated the job-killing North American Trade Agreement (Nafta). He has protected the nation from Islamic terrorists and traditional American culture from corrupting foreign influences. He has exposed the bias of the mainstream media and backed religious freedom for Christians. Trump has appointed reliable conservatives to the supreme court and stood against the baby-killing abortion industry. For detractors, Trump is a phony populist whose policies have benefited the rich and imposed a crushing burden of debt on the American people. By rolling back environmental regulations and withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, he has exposed Americans to the ravages of catastrophic climate change. He has diminished America\u2019s international standing, and instead of championing democracy and human rights, he has cultivated some of world\u2019s most brutal dictators. Trump has lied repeatedly to the American people, demeaned women and minorities, undermined the free press, condoned violence against his enemies, and attacked migrants and refugees as murderers and rapists. For his most ardent critics, Trump has destroyed civility and created a toxic environment that contributed to Robert Bowers\u2019 massacre of congregants at the Tree of Life synagogue and Cesar Sayoc\u2019s dispatching of bombs to CNN and critics of Trump. Two-thirds of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll taken in late October said that Trump will be a factor in their midterm votes; 23% said that he will be a minor factor; 44% said he will be a major factor. A similar poll taken before the midterm elections of 2014 found that then president Barack Obama would be either a minor or a major factor in voting for only 47% of respondents. \u201cThis is definitively a national election,\u201d Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, said. \u201cWith a referendum on Trump.\u201d Voter turnout is typically low in midterm elections, falling well below participation in parliamentary elections in other advanced democracies. Only about 38% of US citizens voted in the 2014 midterms, leaving some 140m votes on the table. But Trump will likely inspire higher turnout this year. He \u201chas attracted passionate loyalty, and passionate antagonism, and hatred and love tend to drive people to the polls\u201d, Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, said. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see a much higher than normal turnout for the midterms.\u201d Unlike the past two midterm elections, polls indicate that this year Democrats have equaled or gained the edge on Republicans in voter enthusiasm. A Gallup Poll conducted from mid- to late-October found that \u201cDemocrats match or exceed Republicans on turnout indicators.\u201d. Republicans have countered with voter suppression efforts. Republicans know that their base of older white Christians is the most rapidly shrinking part of the electorate. They cannot manufacture more of these voters, but they can restrict turnout by the rising Democratic base of minorities and young people through purges of registration rolls, stringent voter ID laws, poll closings and exact-match laws that suspend voters\u2019 registration for the smallest mismatch between information on the registration forms and driver\u2019s licenses or social security records. In Georgia, relying on a 2017 exact-match law passed by the Republican legislature, Brian Kemp, the Republican secretary of state who is also running for governor, suspended some 53,000 registrations. Minorities accounted for some 80% of suspended registrations. In North Dakota, after Democrat Heidi Heitkamp was elected senator by 3,000 votes in 2012, the Republican legislature required proof of a street address as a prerequisite for voting. The law placed a disparate burden on the Democratic base of Native American voters, who often live on unnamed roads and depend upon post office boxes for the delivery of mail. Yet, voting restrictions may backfire on Republicans by motivating opposition voters. In North Dakota, Mark Trahant, editor of Indian Country Today, said that in the past \u201cthe Native vote has not necessarily turned out \u2026 but with tribes working overtime to help members obtain valid addresses and ID, she [Heitkamp] actually could get a turnout of Native voters she wouldn\u2019t have gotten any other way\u201d. In Georgia, Kemp\u2019s Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, an African American woman, has urged supporters to flood the polls to fight \u201cvoter suppression\u201d. In a leaked audio recording, Kemp confidentially warned supporters about \u201cthe literally tens of millions of dollars that they\u201d \u2013 his opponents \u2013 \u201care putting behind the get out and vote efforts for their base\u201d. Kemp was especially concerned about absentee ballots, and what would happen \u201cif everybody uses and exercises their right to vote, which they absolutely can, and mails those ballots in\u201d.

Will Republicans will be able to keep control of both chambers of Congress? Or will Democrats win one, or both, thus gaining more power to limit Trump\u2019s policy agenda? Here\u2019s what you need to know: What are the midterm elections? The US votes for a president in a general election every four years. Midterm elections take place halfway through a president\u2019s term (hence the name, midterm) and are often seen as a referendum on the current administration. They\u2019re different from state and local elections, which happen every year. What\u2019s up for grabs? All 435 seats in the US House of Representatives One third (35) of all seats in the US Senate Thirty-six state governorships, and three US territory governorships Many city mayorships and local officials More than 150 ballot measures. In Florida alone, voters will decide on 12 issues, which range from whether to ban vaping in indoor workplaces, to restoring the voting rights of former felons. What\u2019s at stake? The Senate and the House of Representatives make up the upper and lower chambers of Congress, which is the legislative branch of the federal government, and is responsible for making laws. Republicans currently have a majority in both chambers. 51 seats or more are needed to control the Senate 218 seats will secure a majority in the House To take control of the Senate, Democrats need to keep all the seats they currently hold, and take two further seats, which is harder than it sounds. To win a majority in the House, they need a net gain of 23 seats. Republicans also currently hold 26 of the 36 governors\u2019 seats that are up for grabs. If the Democrats can increase the number they hold, it will offer them more opportunities to frustrate Trump\u2019s agenda outside Washington. Why do the midterms matter? Historically, voter turnout for midterm elections tends to be lower than for general elections, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t important. With a Senate majority, the Democrats would be able to block cabinet and supreme court appointments. With a House majority, Democrats can significantly hamper the Trump administration\u2019s ability to implement its programs and could also begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, though they would need a two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove him from office. What\u2019s likely to happen? According to polls, Democrats are currently forecast to win the House but not the Senate. But as we saw in 2016, polls can get it wrong, and surprises do happen\u2026", "23||Poem of the week: Green Boughs by Naomi MitchisonGreen Boughs My young, dear friends are dead, All my own generation. Pity a youthless nation, Pity the girls unwed, Whose young lovers are dead. They came from the gates of birth To boyhood happy and strong, To a youth of glorious days, We give them honour and song, And theirs, theirs is the praise. But the old inherit the earth. They knew what was right and wrong, They were idealists, Clean minds, my friends, my friends! Artists and scientists, Their lives that should have been long! But everything lovely ends. They came from college or school, They did not falter or tire, But the old, the stupid had rule Over that eager nation, And all my own generation They have cast into the fire. Marking the Armistice centenary next Sunday, this week\u2019s poem is both a personal elegy for the writer\u2019s friends and a lament for a generation. Green Boughs is included in A Gathering: A Personal Anthology of Scottish Poems, edited by Alexander McCall Smith, and it\u2019s interesting to speculate as to whether it was influenced by Jean Elliot\u2019s magnificent and timeless classic, The Flowers of the Forest, the anthology\u2019s closing poem. Both are collective elegies for the fallen (and have similarly symbolic titles). Elliot gives us the living presence of the young men: Mitchison generalises. But both poets bring more than public feeling to the tribute of \u201chonour and song\u201d. Mitchison was a prolific writer, a social activist and a novelist in various genres. She published only two collections of poems during her life, with a gap of more than 50 years between them. Both The Laburnum Branch (1926), where Green Boughs first appeared, and The Cleansing of the Knife and Other Poems (1978) include poems that are pioneering contributions to what is virtually an independent genre: war poems by women and non-combatants. In her more experimental second world war poems, Mitchison found a fruitful source in the work she did for the Mass Observation organisation. Green Boughs, while altogether more traditional, draws on direct emotional experience, not only the loss of friends in her intellectual circle, but the close brush with death when her brother and husband were both severely wounded in the fighting. Despite their focus on an elite of young, gifted and privileged \u201cartists and scientists\u201d, these swift-moving, sometimes rough-hewn, rhymed verses seem driven to reach beyond social boundaries and heroic stereotypes. When the poet exclaims, \u201cMy young, dear friends are dead, / All my own generation\u201d, we hear it as an outcry that all her own generation is dead. It\u2019s ambiguously phrased: what the poet more likely means is that the dead friends all belonged to her generation. But there is an elegist\u2019s licence at work here: public grief is allowed to exaggerate, and we want it to do so. Our reading is nourished by what we later generations know about the mass scale of the slaughter, acknowledged in the term \u201cthe lost generation\u201d and our willingness to mourn the dead, regardless of their class, their talents. Private loss and public knowledge are elided, even here, and, as it rings out at the end of the poem, there\u2019s no doubt about the inclusiveness of the lament: \u201cAnd all my own generation / They have cast into the fire\u201d. Although there\u2019s an affinity with ballad form, the 23 trimetrical lines of Green Boughs are not comfortably shoehorned into quatrains. After the formal premonition of an ABBA pattern, the A-rhyme recurs a third time, when line five picks up the word, \u201cdead\u201d. The second quatrain, or ghost-quatrain, has no integral rhyme-scheme: we must wait for the next verse to make the connections. This verse, beginning \u201cWe give them honour and song\u201d, is more effective if read as a three-line stanza, ending on \u201cBut the old inherit the earth\u201d. The following lines return to the subject of the young in proclaiming, \u201cThey knew what was right and wrong, / They were idealists\u201d \u2013 although for a moment we might imagine the poet has simultaneously embedded a satirical treatment of \u201cthe old\u201d. But she is far too single-minded for such a detour, and returns to her eulogy, the praise often conventionally worded, yet never sounding less than deeply felt. The triple rhymes in the poem chime strongly, even when placed several lines apart. In the last quatrain, the two B-rhymes of the opening reappear in reversed order, making an inventive recapitulation of the major themes: nation / generation. The formal and syntactical irregularities are energising, appropriately discordant and emotionally jagged, given the subject. Green Boughs doesn\u2019t aim to tell a story: it is itself the \u201csong\u201d referred to in line nine, and we seem to hear it cried out, almost improvised, on a single breath. Angry with the fossilised controllers of power, and instinctively identifying with the \u201ceager nation\u201d of young idealists with their now incorruptibly \u201cclean minds\u201d, Green Boughs is a reflection of the qualities it admires. It\u2019s a young person\u2019s poem, fired with the kind of grief and outrage that may, with tragic irony, be called upon to add fresh heat to the crucible of warfare. \u2022 Green Boughs by Naomi Mitchison appears in A Gathering: A Personal Anthology of Scottish Poems, edited by Alexander McCall Smith; it was originally published in Mitchison\u2019s collection The Laburnum Branch (Jonathan Cape, 1926).", "9||Environment department accused of Brexit \u2018panic\u2019 after urgent staff demandThe environment department has been accused of \u201cpanic\u201d over Brexit after a leaked document revealed the emergency redeployment of staff to prepare for a no-deal scenario. Managers at the Environment Agency (EA) were given just 24 hours to name 75 staff to be sent to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). In September, the National Audit Office said Michael Gove\u2019s department will not be ready for a no-deal Brexit, with meat and dairy and chemicals exports especially threatened. The loss of staff at the EA has also raised concerns. It is responsible for protecting the country from flooding as well as water, land and air pollution, but lost a significant number of staff between 2010 and 2018. The EA memo, headed \u201cURGENT Action \u2013 immediate attention\u201d and leaked to the Guardian, said: \u201cWe are gearing up our contingency planning for EU Exit and have been asked by Defra as a matter of urgency to provide staff.\u201d It was sent on 22 October, with staff asked to redeploy within a week. \u201cWe realise this is an extremely short deadline and that many staff will be on half term,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever, please do your best as part of our ambition to go the extra mile to help at this challenging time.\u201d Another 75 staff are being taken from other environmental agencies overseen by Defra, which include Natural England and the Animal and Plant Health Agency. The government will not reveal how many staff have already been seconded. Defra is responsible for almost a fifth of all the Brexit-related workstreams across government, covering the food and chemical industries, farming, fisheries and the environment. Tim Farron, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said: \u201cThe news that Defra is desperately trying to get staff before Brexit day is deeply worrying, no matter the outcome of negotiations. This smacks of panic and desperation, as they try to dig themselves out of the hole they\u2019ve dug. It means that deal or no deal, this government is deeply unprepared for the chaos Brexit will cause.\u201d Sue Hayman, Labour\u2019s shadow environment secretary, said: \u201cThis panic in Defra comes just weeks after the National Audit Office (NAO) raised the alarm over the chronic lack of Brexit preparedness in Michael Gove\u2019s department.\u201d \u201cThe Environment Agency has already been subject to brutal cuts by this government since 2010 and there are serious questions about the agency\u2019s ability to respond to emergencies such as flash floods with this further hollowing out,\u201d she said. \u201cMichael Gove is rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship.\u201d The number of core staff employed by Defra, rather than by its agencies, was hit heavily by budget cuts between 2010 and 2016, falling by 25% to 1,827. But since the vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, the number of staff has almost doubled. Despite this, the NAO report concluded: \u201cFor some workstreams, Defra has passed the point where it will be able to deliver what it had initially planned for a \u2018no-deal\u2019 exit in March 2019.\u201d The main roles urgently needed by Defra, according to the leaked memo, are in policy, project delivery and communication. \u201cOver 80% of Defra\u2019s agenda is affected by Brexit and as a result, a number of staff from across the Defra group are now supporting our comprehensive programme of work,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the Defra group. \u201cHowever, we are clear this must not impact our commitment to protecting our environment and the vital work of the Environment Agency in areas such as flood protection or tackling waste crime.\u201d After the NAO\u2019s report, Rebecca Hesketh, Brexit adviser at the National Farmers Union, said: \u201cThe NAO stated that the planning for many of Defra\u2019s work streams was \u2018poor quality\u2019 and \u2018lacked maturity\u2019, with the department reportedly missing a \u2018high proportion of its project milestones\u2019. This lack of preparedness is worrying.\u201d", "14||UK services growth hits seven-month low amid Brexit uncertaintyThe risk of a disorderly Brexit and growing signs of weakness in the world economy are combining to drag several UK business sectors close to stalling point in the final months of the year. Suggesting that the period of relatively robust economic growth over the hot summer months has begun to cool, the latest surveys of business activity for October revealed a marked slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018. The UK\u2019s services sector, the largest contributor to economic growth, which includes hotels, restaurants, transport and finance, expanded at the slowest pace since March according to the latest snapshot report published on Monday from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips). It said Brexit-related uncertainty and concerns about the global economic outlook had constrained growth, while it also recorded the weakest upturn in services firms taking on new work since straight after the EU referendum in 2016. The monthly IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index, which is closely watched by the Bank of England and the Treasury, dropped to 52.2 last month from 53.9 in September, its weakest for seven months on a scale where a reading above 50 signals economic growth. Economists forecast that GDP growth will slow to 0.2% in the final quarter of the year from about 0.6% in the third quarter, handing Theresa May disappointing news as she attempts to negotiate a withdrawal agreement from the EU. Consumer-facing sectors such as hotels, restaurants and leisure reported the weakest performance in October, after recording more robust activity during the summer months, when warm weather and the World Cup encouraged an upturn in consumer spending. Duncan Brock, group director at Cips, said: \u201cMany of the respondents attributed this poor performance and the biggest softening in new order growth since July 2016 to continuing ambiguity around the Brexit negotiations.\u201d New car sales suffered another disappointing month in October, as the number of vehicle registrations dropped for the seventh consecutive month, falling by 2.9% year on year to stand at 153,599 units. Fuelled by a 21% drop in diesel registrations, the figures come after car sales plunged by a fifth in September, which is usually a bumper month for the motor trade. Waning appetite for diesel cars amid changes to government policy, as well as weak consumer confidence, weighed on demand. The slowdown in the services industry last month followed disappointing news from the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a tenth of GDP. Britain\u2019s factories recorded a sharp slowdown in output in October, as new orders declined for first time since mid-2016. Chris Sood-Nicholls, the head of global services at Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cWith autumn upon us, consumers are tightening their belts. And with the prospect of any greater certainty seemingly as distant as ever, businesses across the disparate services sector are struggling to maintain their confident outlook.\u201d While business activity in Britain is struggling under the uncertainty posed by Brexit, the global economy has also begun slowing amid the US trade dispute with China and Europe. With Italy engaged in a standoff with the EU over its budget, economic growth in the eurozone dropped to 0.2% in the third quarter, the lowest level for four years. However, the UK economy is still proving to be more resilient than many economists had predicted ahead of the EU referendum, despite the slowdown. Data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the accountancy firm KPMG found that growth in high street sales picked up to an annual rate of 1.3% in October, against an increase of 0.2% in the same month a year ago. Data from Barclaycard, which accounts for nearly half of the UK\u2019s credit and debit card sales, found that ticket sales rose by 22.1% compared with the same month a year ago, influenced by the sale of Glastonbury tickets for 2019, after the music festival was not held in 2018.", "10||Metropolitan police rush to set up no-deal Brexit 'safety net unit'A \u201cno deal safety net unit\u201d is being rushed through by Scotland Yard at a cost of more than \u00a32.4m after police chiefs warned the home secretary that losing EU tools would make it harder to track sex offenders and terrorist suspects, according to internal police documents. The initial cost to the taxpayer was subsequently inflated by \u00a3250,000 to allow the new unit to rent an office near parliament after the Metropolitan police said it did not have the space given the large size of the team. Discussions are ongoing about the extent of the running costs to the taxpayer should the UK crash out in March. The development comes as the British negotiating team and the European commission\u2019s taskforce, led by Michel Barnier, prepare to enter a secretive phase known as the \u201ctunnel\u201d this week, amid warnings that the competing red lines remain incompatible in key areas. EU officials have told the Guardian that the chances of such a breakthrough stand at \u201c50/50\u201d with serious differences remaining over how to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in all circumstances. It has been suggested that it might be possible as a backstop for a UK-wide customs union to replace the Northern Ireland-specific text, which would have left open the chance of a customs border in the Irish Sea. The price to be paid would be an admission on the behalf of Downing Street that this customs arrangement would be open-ended rather than time-limited, in a move that would enrage Conservative Brexiters. On Monday, the Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, tweeted: \u201cThe Irish position remains consistent and v clear\u2069 that a \u2018time-limited backstop\u2019 or a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to by IRE or EU. These ideas are not backstops at all + don\u2019t deliver on previous UK commitments.\u201d The EU\u2019s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, retweeted Coveney, adding: \u201cStill necessary to repeat this, it seems.\u201d Jacob Rees Mogg, the chairman of the Eurosceptic European Research Group, tweeted that the government\u2019s pledge to leave the customs union was \u201ca promise that must not be broken\u201d, adding: \u201cIs the government about to abandon Brexit?\u201d The Home Office approved the funding for the new safety net unit after asking the National Crime Agency and National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) in September to draft plans for a \u201cno deal, no implementation period\u201d scenario, in which the UK would not secure a transition period in which to prepare for the consequences of Brexit. A report from Scotland Yard\u2019s deputy assistant commissioner, Richard Martin, seen by the Guardian, says police urgently need to \u201cmitigate the impact of UK losing access to EU tools such as a database that monitors the movements of sex offenders and suspected terrorists. Martin, a senior Met officer who leads on Brexit for the NPCC, writes: \u201cOn a Brexit no-deal scenario, the UK will lose access to European measures, tools and mechanisms. These instruments are used on a daily basis in operational policing and unless the UK can negotiate continued access to them we will no longer be able to use them. \u201cSimilarly, EU member states will not be able to use them to work with UK law enforcement to help protect their citizens. \u201cThe loss of one or more of these measures will have significant implications for policing. Frontline officers will be less connected to alerts from EU partners about suspects they encounter and it will be harder to monitor the movements of sex offenders or terrorist suspects if we lose the Schengen Information System II (SIS II).\u201d British police officers checked SIS II about 539m times in 2017 alone. The Met was unable to find large enough accommodation for the new unit, and received agreement last week for extra funding given \u201cthe size of the team and the requirements of the unit\u201d. The internal document reports that the \u2018safety net\u2019 unit need has to be implemented \u201cin readiness for exit day\u201d. \u201cThe process to recruit and set in place the infrastructure to create the model would have to begin immediately as the time to get the resources in place, develop communications, national guidance, and deliver training will require a significant lead time\u201d, the paper says. The cost of the lease for the new building in Old Queen Street in Westminster, due to end in December 2020, is \u00a3266,355. A document says: \u201cThe unit will be hosted by the Met police but will be a national resource under NPCC governance. \u201cIt will be staffed by officers and staff from police forces, the National Crime Agency and the National Criminal Records Office with a central coordination team and a network of regional single points of contact (SPCOs) who will advise and help forces to use alternative mechanisms.\u201d", "1||Talking Horses: overseas raiders set their sights on Melbourne CupNo sooner had Ryan Moore crossed the line on fifth-placed Mendelssohn in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic on Saturday night than he was on his way to the airport for a flight to Australia to partner The Cliffsofmoher in Tuesday\u2019s Melbourne Cup. And he was not the only one, as British and Irish stables are responsible for no fewer than 10 of the 24 runners in Australia\u2019s biggest race, which is due off at 4.00am GMT. The overseas challenge also includes the first five names in the betting, and some \u2013 perhaps many \u2013 Australian fans have already given up this year\u2019s Cup as lost. No British stable has ever won while Ireland has three victories, France has two and even Germany are on the board thanks to Protectionist\u2019s win for Andreas Wohler four years ago, with Moore in the saddle. No-one will ever come closer than Luca Cumani in 2008, when his runner-up, Bauer, memorably recorded a faster time than the winner, Viewed. This was thanks to a quirk of the timing system, as the chip in his saddle-cloth completed the two-mile trip faster than the one carried by Viewed. Sadly for Bauer\u2019s connections, however, his nose did not. Aidan O\u2019Brien, meanwhile, has also tried and failed several times at Flemington Park, while his son, Joseph, nailed it at the first attempt 12 months ago when Rekindling beat his father\u2019s Johannes Vermeer by half a length with Willie Mullins\u2019s Max Dynamite completing an Irish 1-2-3. O\u2019Brien Jr does not have a runner this time around, but his father has three, including the likely favourite, Yucatan. He has The Cliffsofmoher, second in last year\u2019s Derby, as backup while Rostropovich has also managed to sneak in as the 24th and final horse in the handicap. British stables are also mob-handed, with Saeed bin Suroor fielding Best Solution, the top weight, three days after his Thunder Snow finished a very creditable third in the Classic at Churchill Downs. Charlie Appleby has a very live contender in Cross Counter, the second-favourite with the British bookies, while Magic Circle, the Chester Cup winner earlier this year, represents the excellent \u2013 and perhaps somewhat under-appreciated \u2013 Ian Williams. Nakeeta and Muntahaa, the last two winners of the Ebor Handicap, go to post for Iain Jardine and John Gosden respectively, while Hughie Morrison\u2019s Marmelo, ninth behind Rekindling last year, is back for another go. Charlie Fellowes\u2019s A Prince Of Arran, who got into the field courtesy of a win at Flemington just two days ago, completes the European challenge for a race that is pretty much guaranteed to produce high drama. Monday\u2019s two jumps cards in the UK, at Plumpton and Hereford, have rather less to offer as fast ground continues to produce some diminished fields. Between The Waters (2.30) and Lovato (3.00) should both go well at the Sussex track, but the best card of the day is on the all-weather at Kempton Park this evening. The action includes a Listed race in which Crowned Eagle (6.00), part-owned by the footballer and keen racing enthusiast Charlie Austin, must go close, while Salute The Soldier (5.30) should follow up his recent win in an excellent time at Chelmsford City. Rosarno (7.00) should run well at a fair price too.", "0||Tell us about the things you do that represent non-capitalist living\u201cMost of us would say, if asked, that we live in a capitalist society, but vast amounts of how we live our everyday lives - our interactions with and commitments to family lives, friendships, avocations, membership in social, spiritual and political organisations - are in essence non capitalist or even anticapitalist, full of things we do for free, out of love and on principle.\u201d The words are taken from Hope In The Dark, the massively influential book by the writer and activist Rebecca Solnit, and they go straight to the heart of something too often overlooked: the way that, in the midst of a culture too often reducible to shopping and spending, millions of people regularly do things that go against the capitalist and consumerist grain \u2013 volunteering, freecycling, making and growing their own stuff, sustaining large and small relationships that have nothing to do with money-making. In the digital era, moreover, these activities have another political element, albeit with a small \u2018p\u2019: emphasising human contact over screentime. The positive flipside of the internet age, of course, is that such things are now comparatively easy to get going, and then publicise. So we want to know about practical examples of everyday things that represent non-capitalist living, and how to do them.

While her commitment to the part might sound excessive, we\u2019re seeing this kind of thing happen more in movies. You could draw an inappropriately shaped line from Mark Wahlberg\u2019s lovingly crafted accessory in Boogie Nights (scaled down from Dirk Diggler\u2019s real-life inspiration, John \u201c13 \u00bd inches\u201d Holmes) to the abominably proportioned monster on display in The Greasy Strangler, stopping in between at movies such as The Overnight, in which Jason Schwartzman and Adam Scott compare sizes. It is in the area of sex that fake genitals are most often called for. We can think we\u2019re seeing the real thing when we aren\u2019t. In Blue Is the Warmest Colour, for example, its stars used fake vulvas for their overextended lesbian sex scenes. And Lars Von Trier\u2019s Nymphomaniac used fake sex organs (as well as \u201cporn doubles\u201d) rather than making stars Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stacy Martin perform actual sex acts. This is something of a reversal from the late 1990s, when real on-screen sex was seen as a taboo-busting advance. Von Trier provided the first on-screen penetration in a mainstream UK movie with 1998\u2019s The Idiots (the director put the cast at ease by directing naked). In the early 2000s, Kerry Fox was giving Mark Rylance fellatio for real in Intimacy, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny was doing the same with Vincent Gallo in The Brown Bunny, and Michael Winterbottom was serving up similar scenes in 9 Songs. Relaxation of UK censorship laws meant more was permitted. After this period, however, lines started to become uncomfortably blurred. Actors are now mindful that their sex or nude scenes could find a permanent home at the pornier margins of the internet. Such scenes can overshadow other aspects of a movie: new Robert the Bruce pic Outlaw King, for example, has so far prompted less discussion of Scottish history than it has of Chris Pine\u2019s \u201cdazzling\u201d penis. Or you could become the subject of an excruciating skit such as Seth MacFarlane\u2019s 2013 Oscar ceremony song, We Saw Your Boobs. Yes, that really happened. That\u2019s not to say we need a new age of Mary Whitehouse-style censorship and prudishness, but there are alternatives. HBO show The Deuce recently took the step of hiring an \u201cintimacy coordinator\u201d to oversee its (prosthetics-assisted) sex and nudity scenes more sensitively. Now HBO has pledged to employ one on every production. Maybe everyone else should too. We can applaud Swinton for her extreme commitment to the role in Suspiria, but it turns out there are limits to how method you need to get. And how much of our actors we really need to see. Suspiria is in UK cinemas from 16 November", "16||Winter blues? A practical guide to getting more light in your lifeApril is allegedly the cruellest month, but October and November could give it a run for its money. In the northern hemisphere, the nights are noticably drawing in, especially now the clocks have gone back and sunset is an hour earlier. Every day, it gets darker two minutes earlier than it did the day before. And, while there are compensations \u2013 hello moon! Hello stars! Hello, most of all, Orion the Hunter, back in our northern skies after long months below the horizon \u2013 many of us cannot be consoled. As one of his patients told the US psychiatrist Norman Rosenthal: \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how quickly we haemorrhage light\u201d. \u201cI love that expression \u2018the haemorrhaging of light,\u2019\u201d Rosenthal says. \u201cWith a haemorrhage, you feel depleted, you feel exhausted. It dramatises something that\u2019s real.\u201d According to Rosenthal, who has spent more than 30 years studying the effects of seasonal changes on mood, about one in five Americans suffer some sort of \u201cwinter blues\u201d. He is one of them. When we speak, it is 8.30am in his hometown of Bethesda, Maryland, and he is sitting in front of a light designed to reduce the symptoms. Things are even worse in the UK, especially after the kind of long, hot summer that we have just enjoyed. \u201cCloud cover is very important,\u201d Rosenthal explains. \u201cHistorically, Britain is a cloudy nation. It\u2019s an island nation, there\u2019s a lot of fog and cloud coming off the sea. More recently, your summers have been more like ours \u2013 hot and sunny and dry. Now, when you have a hot, sunny and dry summer and a cloudy, dark winter, that\u2019s when the seasonality of the problem becomes more apparent.\u201d The further north you go, the gloomier it gets. In the winter, there are parts of northern Scotland that get an average of just 64 minutes of sunlight a day, according to the Met Office. Perhaps a quarter of those with winter blues develop the extreme form known as seasonal affective disorder, or Sad. \u201cThis is characterised by the typical features of depression \u2013 poor sleep, low mood, irritability, social withdrawal and perhaps overeating, too,\u201d says Sally Norton, a consultant surgeon and weight-loss expert with an interest in Sad. \u201cIt is probably, in part, related to hormonal changes around those chemical messengers such as serotonin and melatonin involved in regulating our body clock.\u201d Mark Winwood, a director of psychological services for Axa PPP healthcare, adds that people with Sad \u201cmay find it very difficult to wake up in the morning and can often feel sleepy during the day. You may crave chocolate and high-carbohydrate foods, such as white bread or sugary foods. And you probably won\u2019t be doing as much physically, so it\u2019s easy to put on weight.\u201d Sad and the winter blues are sometimes described as separate conditions, but Rosenthal prefers to talk of a \u201cspectrum\u201d. \u201cSome people are really laid low by it and some people are just hampered by it. Let\u2019s say your wife has Sad and you\u2019ve got a little bit of winter blues. You get up in the morning and you don\u2019t feel as good as you do in the summer, but you get yourself together and by the middle of the morning you\u2019re not feeling so bad. But your wife can\u2019t get out of bed at all. And you say: \u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter with you, dear. I get up, I go to work \u2026\u2019 It\u2019s important to realise that a person isn\u2019t fixed in a category. They can move to and fro depending on what they do and how bad the winter is.\u201d So, what can you do about it? \u201c\u2018Take it seriously\u2019 is always my first piece of advice,\u201d says Rosenthal. \u201cYou Brits are famous for your stiff upper lip and just getting on with the job, but that is the philosophy of minimising and denial. If there was nothing you can do about it, fine \u2013 but there is.\u201d The worst cases may call for antidepressants or cognitive behavioural therapy. Otherwise, you could try spending a few hours every day in front of a lightbox, like the one Rosenthal uses. He recommends the specialist suppliers Lumie and the Sad Lightbox Company, and a box that will put out at least 10,000 lux. (By way of comparison, a sunny summer\u2019s day might deliver 100,000 lux.) If you don\u2019t spend much time at home, there are portable versions that are barely bigger than an iPad. \u201cMorning treatments are best,\u201d Rosenthal says. \u201cThe earlier the better.\u201d He is also a fan of dawn simulators, which gradually light up your bedroom in the morning. Although winter\u2019s late sunrises feel less oppressive than its early sunsets, that does not mean they don\u2019t affect us. Most of the advice for dealing with Sad or the winter blues boils down to: \u201cGet more light.\u201d You can start by making at least one room in your home as bright as possible, by adding artificial light, opening curtains, rolling up blinds, cleaning your windows and trimming any plants that obscure them. Then, even if it is raining, snowing or blowing a gale, get outdoors as much as possible. As Winwood says: \u201cNatural daylight supports our circadian clock and helps us sleep at night. So, even if you seem to go to work when it\u2019s dark and also go home when it\u2019s dark, get out in the lunch hour. Even better, use it as a time to do your daily exercise.\u201d Exercise, after all, is known to improve your mood, whatever the time of year. Even \u2013 especially \u2013 if you don\u2019t think of yourself as a winter person, it is worth investing in warm clothes so the weather can\u2019t keep you cooped up. While you are out, the sunlight will encourage your body to produce vitamin D. Although Norton says there is only \u201climited evidence\u201d for vitamin D improving mood, \u201cthere is no doubt that many of us are deficient in the winter months\u201d. When the night falls, don\u2019t fight it too hard. \u201cOur tendency to turn on blazing lights as soon as the light drops is bound to confuse our body,\u201d Norton says. \u201cTry to keep lights dim in the evening and let your body clock tell you when it\u2019s time to sleep. Getting to bed early enough to get a good eight hours will help your mood and so much more.\u201d And stay away from screens for at least two hours before you go to bed. \u201cThey suppress the sleep hormone melatonin, making it more difficult to drift off and reducing sleep quality.\u201d You should also watch what you eat, she warns. \u201cWhile low mood and poor sleep has many people reaching for high-carb, sugary food, this is unlikely to help in the long term, with weight gain and yo-yoing blood sugar making sleep more difficult and worsening mood further.\u201d The important thing, Rosenthal repeats, is to realise that you are not powerless. \u201cI find people who say: \u2018I can\u2019t deal with it!\u2019 And I think to myself: \u2018Let\u2019s just put everything in place for you to have the best possible winter.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s not just about managing winter,\u201d he says. \u201cI think you need to enjoy it. Life should be embraced.\u201d Norman Rosenthal\u2019s Winter Blues is published by Guilford Press.", "13||Sadiq Khan defends violent crime strategy after London stabbingsEfforts to reduce violent crimes such as stabbings by treating them in part as a public health issue could take up to a decade to bring proper results, London\u2019s mayor has said, following the deaths of three young people in the capital since Thursday. Sadiq Khan, who is facing pressure following an increase in such crimes this year, said the police response also played a role, and that the rise in murders should also be seen in the context of cuts to policing and public services. The Home Office minister Victoria Atkins denied that police cuts could be blamed, saying a government study had found no apparent connection between police numbers and earlier rises in violent crime. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme after three males between the ages of 15 and 22 died in stabbing incidents on Thursday, Friday and Sunday, Khan said London had since 2016 followed the example of Glasgow, which saw a significant drop in violent crime after establishing a violence reduction unit to treat the problem in a holistic way. But he said the effects would not be immediate. \u201cIt\u2019ll take some time. The reason I know it\u2019ll take some time is because of the lessons we\u2019ve learned from places like Glasgow in Scotland, where it took them some time to turn this thing around.\u201d Asked how long it might take, Khan said: \u201cAccording to Glasgow \u2013 and we\u2019ve got the violence reduction unit in Glasgow helping us \u2013 to really make significant progress can take up to 10 years, and a generation.\u201d On Sunday, police arrested two men after a man, believed to be 22, died following a stabbing shortly after midday in Anerley, south-east London. On Friday, 17-year-old Malcolm Mide-Madariola died after being stabbed outside Clapham South tube station. The day before Jay Hughes, 15, was fatally stabbed near a chicken shop in Bellingham, south-east London. Khan said the challenge was to break a wider culture in which the use of knives had become normalised among many young people. \u201cThe reason why they say this is because they saw in Scotland what we\u2019re seeing in London, which is children in primary school thinking not only is it OK to carry a knife, but it gives them a sense of belonging, joining a criminal gang. It makes them feel safer, and they don\u2019t see anything wrong in getting involved in this sort of behaviour,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the one hand we\u2019ve got to be tough in relation to enforcement, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got officers as part of the violent crime taskforce doing intelligence-led stop and searches, taking knives off our streets, offensive weapons off our streets, guns off our streets, making arrests. \u201cAt the same time, on the other hand, we\u2019ve got to be giving young people constructive things to do, investing in youth centres, youth workers, after-school clubs.\u201d Khan said efforts had been hampered by a significant drop in police numbers, and a loss of facilities such as youth centres. \u201cIn London we\u2019ve had a public health approach in the context of record cuts in policing and public services.\u201d Some critics of Khan\u2019s approach have called for a resumption in routine stop-and-search operations, a tactic which has been used less since Theresa May as home secretary changed the approach amid concerns people were being unfairly targeted. The London mayor said the Metropolitan police had set up a taskforce to target \u201chabitual knife carriers\u201d in certain areas, which had made more than 1,300 arrests in six months, and that there had been a wider increase in stop and search. He added: \u201cBut you\u2019ll appreciate that because we have fewer officers than any time since 2003 at a time when our population is going up, it\u2019s more and more difficult.\u201d Atkins disputed this, saying: \u201cAs a result of that very intensive piece of work we found that the claim about police numbers isn\u2019t supported by the evidence of previous spikes in serious violence.\u201d Atkins said the \u201cnature of crime is changing\u201d, for example with gang activities being organised via social media. She said: \u201cGangs are far more ruthless than they used to be, the levels of violence that doctors are seeing in A&amp;E shows that incidents that before perhaps wouldn\u2019t have resulted in fatalities now are resulting in fatalities,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we talk about the nature of crime we\u2019re taking into account, for example, that the gangs that are behind the vast majority of these murders, are using social media to communicate.\u201d", "6||Football transfer rumours: David Luiz to Bar\u00e7a? Wan-Bissaka to Everton?Despite having just 20 first-team appearances to his name for Crystal Palace across two seasons, Aaron Wan-Bissaka has made quite the name for himself. Valued at \u00a34m, the 20-year-old right-back was among the cheapest players available on Fantasy Premier League \u2013 the official nerd nirvana of the competition of the same name \u2013 at the start of the season and shrewd armchair managers have accumulated plenty of points by including this bargain-basement buy in their starting lineups. Everton manager Marco Silva now wants in on the act, but will have to pay considerably more, in actual real money, to bring the young Londoner to Merseyside as back-up for S\u00e9amus Coleman. The Sun reports that Palace will not sanction any sale of Wan-Bissaka in January, but could let him go next summer. Short of firepower up front, Crystal Palace may ask for Ademola Lookman or Cenk Tosun in part exchange. Having scored 22 goals in 27 appearances for LA Galaxy in the most recent MLS campaign, footballing wallflower Zlatan Ibrahimovic could rejoin his former club Milan. Sky Italia says the Swedish striker is mulling over a return to the Rossoneri, who needed a 97th-minute winner from Alessio Romagnoli to see off Udinese at the Dacia Arena on Sunday. Ibrahimovic, 37, is reported to be looking for an 18-month deal, but Milan are hoping he\u2019ll accept something a little shorter. Reports from Spain suggest Barcelona are in the market for an experienced centre-back and have identified Chelsea\u2019s David Luiz and Arsenal\u2019s Laurent Koscielny as potential recruits. David Luiz has been a regular starter for Chelsea this season, while his French counterpart is targeting a return to Arsenal\u2019s first team this month having been sidelined with a bad achilles injury since 3 May. Real Madrid\u2019s in no way tedious pursuit of Eden Hazard rumbles on and on, with Marco Asensio now being touted as a potential makeweight in any deal with Chelsea that gets done in the foreseeable future. Currently plying his trade in Italy with Parma, Arsenal old boy Gervinho is being linked with a return to the Premier League as a West Ham player. The 31-year-old Ivorian last muddied his spats in the English top flight in 2013, but will return in January if Manuel Pellegrini gets his way. Scoring for fun in the Championship with Leeds United, it\u2019s no surprise that Kemar Roofe has attracted the attention of a number of top-flight clubs. Crystal Palace, Wolves and Southampton are all rumoured to be sniffing around the striker who is in the form of his life playing for the league leaders under Marcelo Bielsa. And finally, the future of Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey remains undecided but serial Bundesliga winners Bayern Munich are the latest high-profile side to be linked with a move for the Welsh international, who is free to leave his current home at the end of the season.", "28||More landlords to be forced to improve energy efficiencyMore landlords will be forced to upgrade the energy efficiency of the coldest homes in England and Wales, under a partial climbdown by the government. Owners of the draughtiest homes \u2013 those rated in the worst energy bands, F and G \u2013 have been been required since April to upgrade them to band E or be barred from agreeing new tenancies. The government previously proposed that landlords who faced costs exceeding \u00a32,500 for putting in new insulation and other measures would be exempt from making the upgrades. That was half the ceiling previously expected, letting many landlords off the hook and leaving tenants facing higher energy bills. But on Monday the government announced it is lifting the cap to \u00a33,500, meaning fewer owners would be exempt. Campaigners said the concession was long overdue but would still leave an unnecessary number of tenants paying over the odds to heat their homes. Max Wakefield, the lead campaigner at green group 10:10 Climate Action, said: \u201cWhilst this move is a step forward the government has chosen not to take the advice of fuel poverty campaigners by setting a higher landlord cap of \u00a35,000. \u201cThis means that those in the very worst homes will still be left in the cold.\u201d The regulations on energy efficiency standards for private rental sector properties affect about 290,000 F- and G-rated homes in England and Wales. The government expects the upgrades to cost landlords \u00a31,200 on average, resulting in average energy bill savings of \u00a3180 a year for tenants. But campaigners said that lifting the cap on landlords\u2019 costs from \u00a32,500 to \u00a33,500 would only help an additional 5,000 homes, based on the government\u2019s own impact assessment. Lifting it to \u00a35,000, as first proposed and recommended by fuel poverty groups, would have helped 40,000 extra. Peter Smith, the director of policy and research at fuel poverty group National Energy Action, said there had been some improvement on previous proposals. \u201cBut the vast majority of private landlords are still going to be able to rent out properties which are dangerously cold and damp,\u201d he said. Energy minister Claire Perry said: \u201cEveryone should be protected against the cold in their own home and today\u2019s announcement will bring this reality closer.\u201d The cap is expected to take effect at some point in 2019. In the meantime, landlords can claim an exemption regardless of the level of the costs they face.", "23||The Vogue review \u2013 bigotry and other crimesAnna Burns might recently have become the first Northern Irish writer in history to win the Booker prize, but the six counties have long boasted a roster of superb and subtle novelists, among them David Park and Eoin McNamee, the latter best known for Resurrection Man and the Blue trilogy. With The Vogue, a desolate tale of secrecy and repression set in a depopulated coastal town, McNamee both conjures the braided ghost stories of the past and gestures towards many of their legacies, including the fate of unmarried mothers, institutional cruelty and the suppression of personal history. As we move from an army camp in Shepton Mallet in 1944, where the black American serviceman Gabriel Hooper awaits a court martial and possible hanging, to the town of Morne \u2013 in both the 1970s and at the turn of the millennium \u2013 the novel\u2019s ambitious structure becomes apparent. Mysterious figures include Cole, a stranger who has travelled from rural Scotland to Northern Ireland to investigate the discovery of a woman\u2019s skeleton in a sandpit; the Rev Wesley Upritchard, leader of the town\u2019s dominant religious sect, the Elected Brethren, and owner of the caravan park on which the makeshift grave sits; Kay, a librarian living in a caravan and seeking to mount an exhibition about the town\u2019s past; and Lily, an elderly woman rapidly losing purchase on recall and language. Between them flit other characters, given names but also known by their roles: the Matron, the Magistrate. A familiar scene is set: a crime, a body, a stranger, all of them multiplying as we look further back into the past. Hooper is charged with the rape of a young woman, the daughter of the head of the Brethren, and knows that his innocence will be no defence against his accusers, many of whom have colluded in the case against him. In the 1970s, we are taken into a young offender institution, which we quickly suspect has a strong connection to the recently discovered body. Nearer to the present day, a group of men hustle and connive to prevent their past deeds coming to light, the reader kept guessing over who is responsible for what, and when. McNamee drew on the history of the Greencastle airbase in County Down \u2013 vast and populous in the 1940s, and now derelict \u2013 for his setting. But Morne, the town he has created, could equally stand for anywhere abandoned and loveless, haunted by its previous inhabitants. It seems a place devoid of any comfort, where long-term residents are held in uneasy relation to one another, and newcomers shunned; where weather blasts the meeting point of land and sea, leaving no crack in which to hide. In a striking touch, the town is filled with surveillance devices, its population \u201ccontinually filmed, cameras on the street and inside shops, dramatic texture being added to their lives, being tracked across the retail space, hurrying across the sightlines. In the camera murk everyone looking suspect, shadowed.\u201d Everything is filmed, and yet nothing is seen; in the trial of Hooper, time and space itself has been falsified and remade. And if McNamee\u2019s ultimate narrative purpose is to suggest that these secrets cannot hold for ever, he is thorough about it; by the conclusion of the novel, each character\u2019s story has pivoted a little, shifted from its moorings. What remains, however, is the implacability of prejudice \u2013 the sense that both the racism endured by Hooper and the misogyny enacted on all the novel\u2019s women must simply play out to a logical conclusion. Underscored by McNamee\u2019s fragmentary, elliptical style, the result is fiction at its bleakest, but carrying with it significant force and fury. \u2022 The Vogue by Eoin McNamee is published by Faber (\u00a312.99).

So far, so funny. The truth is that the minor celeb is being sued for breaking his contract. Grown-ish star Luka Sabbat was contracted to post three Instagram stories and a photo, but only delivered on one of the four. That\u2019s a pretty clear-cut case of not doing what you were paid to do, so it should come as no surprise the company that paid Sabbat wants its money back. But what should be of interest is what he represents: the tame end of a much more insidious influencing economy that operates in plain sight while many of the young people that it targets remain unaware. Take the three stories that Sabbat was paid to post. Influencers are supposed to (although often don\u2019t) flag up product placement in photo descriptions (eg #ad) but that is harder to do on stories, which are short videos that come without a description and disappear after 24 hours. Sabbat was also required to pose for photographs during various fashion weeks \u2013 photos that presumably would show a fashionable, influential man who just happened to be wearing Snap Inc glasses when he was papped, rather than one who had been paid $60,000 (\u00a346,000) to do so. Influencers can include proper celebs, Z-listers \u2013 such as previous cast members of Love Island \u2013 and less well-known micro-influencers: people with relatively few followers but who are, nonetheless, deemed to be cool. That last group can include everyone from people being paid to live a fun-loving nomadic lifestyle that, while following their every move on Instagram, make you hate yourself for having a job; to non-celebrities paid in merch in which they just have to walk around looking enviable. It\u2019s a world in which brands are cashing in by bottling up envy and using it to sell everything from overpriced shoes to fancy glasses, injecting a daily dose of paid-for content into our news feeds without our knowledge. For those of us who will never be fashionable, beautiful or beach-ready enough, it means a slow drip-drip of unrealistic lifestyles and unattainable body expectations that only serves to leave us feeling inadequate, and quite possibly with a substantially lighter wallet. The anxiety can be all-consuming. I have looked after 11-year-olds who admit bowing to the pressure of joining Instagram for fear of being viewed by classmates as a nobody for not being on it. I have spoken to young adults who scroll through photos before bedtime that spur them on to skip meals the next day, punishing themselves for not being perfect. The impact on mental health is not fully understood, but young people aren\u2019t stupid \u2013 and they know what\u2019s happening. They rank Instagram as the worst platform for mental health, backing up the research that suggests that young people who use social media heavily are more likely to report mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. And who gains from this? Not society, not the young people being flogged expensive treats, not even the celebs who are now liable to be sued if they don\u2019t bother to post on Instagram at the right time. Ultimately, it\u2019s the big corporations who cream off the profit: $60,000 might seem a lot to pay for four social media posts, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot cheaper than a proper ad campaign, which can cost as much as \u00a330,000 for a 30-second slot on TV \u2013 and has far less chance of sparking any kind of virality among the young, web-savvy target market. We might like to imagine that we\u2019re consumers to these companies, but we\u2019re really the product \u2013 because in the end, what\u2019s even more lucrative to them is our misery, and the desperate urge to spend that it can cause. \u2022 Poppy Noor is a columnist for the Guardian\u2019s G2", "0||China's human rights record to be examined in UN reviewChina\u2019s human rights record will be examined on Tuesday at a UN event expected to focus on Beijing\u2019s treatment of ethnic minorities, detention of activists and suppression of religious and civil freedoms. The process, known as a universal periodic review (UPR), takes place every five years for each UN member state. The country under review is meant to demonstrate how it has followed previous recommendations as well as answer questions from states, NGOs and others. Advance questions from member states have focused on China\u2019s treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, where an estimated 1 million ethnic Uighurs and others are believed to be detained in a network of internment camps. Others raised questions about press freedoms in Hong Kong, where a journalist with the Financial Times was in effect expelled; the detention of Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai; and the detention of human rights defenders such as the lawyer Wang Quanzhang, the Uighur activist Ilham Tohti, and the dissident Huang Qi, who is believed to be suffering from chronic kidney disease, an accumulation of fluid in the brain, and heart disease. On Monday, a group of 14 NGOs called on China to release Huang on the basis that there was an immediate threat to his life. According to the statement, authorities have repeatedly rejected applications for release on medical bail, allowing his health to deteriorate. Critics say this year\u2019s review highlights how China\u2019s human rights record has deteriorated under the leadership of Xi Jinping. \u201cWhat is most telling is that we are asking the same questions as we head into China\u2019s third review. That some of the same issues are still coming up is a powerful statement of how little progress China has made,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch. Rights activists say China has sought to suppress the voices of dissidents at events on the global stage such as this. Fewer Chinese activists and NGOs are participating in the review process than in years past, in what some call the \u201cCao Shunli effect\u201d, after the activist who was detained for participating in China\u2019s UPR in 2009 and 2013. Cao died in a military hospital in 2014 after being denied treatment. \u201cAll UN member states have an equal opportunity to press China on its egregious human rights record, and they shouldn\u2019t waste it,\u201d said John Fisher, the Geneva director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cChinese activists have been imprisoned, tortured, and fatally mistreated for the chance to challenge Beijing over its human rights record.\u201d", "12||Sky faces tough Disney content talks as it leaves the FTSE 100Sky leaves the FTSE 100 this week with its new owner facing the threat of Disney, which narrowly missed out on acquiring the pay-TV group, playing hardball over deals to screen its content, which include the Star Wars films and hits from the Marvel universe. Some of Sky\u2019s key TV and film contracts could be at risk after US pay-TV giant Comcast triumphed over Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox \u2013 now owned by Disney \u2013 in a high-stakes auction. Comcast\u2019s move thwarted Murdoch\u2019s plan to roll Sky into his $71bn (\u00a355bn) deal to sell Fox\u2019s entertainment assets to Disney. Missing out on Sky means that Disney, the biggest Hollywood studio and now owner of the fourth largest in Fox, will be faced with a key decision about the future of its content on a platform owned by a rival. Sky\u2019s current film contract with Disney expires in 2020 and talks over renewing it are expected to include discussions about Fox content, which includes the Simpsons and the X-Men films. One analyst said Disney\u2019s drive to take on Netflix with its own streaming platform puts question marks over its relationship with broadcasters like Sky. \u201cDisney has aggressively set out its stall as wanting to become a direct-to-consumer player,\u201d says Sarah Simon, of research firm Berenberg. \u201cDisney missed buying Sky and competes with Comcast. Disney now doesn\u2019t have any incentive to renew its programming deals with Sky unless it\u2019s on extremely good financial terms.\u201d In the US, Disney has already said it is pulling its content from Netflix, which will cost it hundreds of millions of dollars in annual license fees, as it looks to go direct to consumers with its own entertainment streaming service, Disney Play, next year. The company has already launched a streaming service for its ESPN sports content. Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, has said launching its own service is the world\u2019s biggest entertainment company\u2019s \u201cbiggest priority\u201d for next year \u2013 and it should be viewed as the start of a global play. The Guardian has learned that Sky has recently struck wide-ranging content deals with two of the other major Hollywood studios. Sources say these deals were extensions of existing agreements and struck well ahead of expiry, suggesting Sky is keen to lock-in prime content early ahead of what will be tough negotiations with Disney. \u201cOwning Fox gives Disney a huge amount of negotiating muscle,\u201d said Simon. \u201cDisney is in an increasingly clear strategic position: continue to sell content to aggregators or go direct to consumers.\u201d Sky\u2019s business has long benefited from paying substantial sums to maintain a stranglehold on the rights to be the first to air Hollywood films in the UK. The company has exclusive deals with the so-called big six studios \u2013 Disney, Warner Bros, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures and Universal Studios \u2013 with its monopoly drawing the scrutiny of competition regulators eight years ago. Sky\u2019s deal with Game of Thrones maker HBO, which is part of AT&amp;T-owned WarnerMedia, is also up for renewal in 2020. Brian Roberts, the Comcast chief executive, will be in London this week as Sky is due to be de-listed from the stock market by Wednesday. The de-listing marks the end of an era \u2013 Sky first floated 20% of the business in December 1994 \u2013 and the broadcaster will be re-registered as a private limited company.", "28||Scared to take time off work? The productivity drive is making victims of us allI realise this is a complaint worthy of the tiniest of violins, but I find going on holiday very stressful. It\u2019s not the packing, the travel or the jetlag that is stress-inducing \u2013 it\u2019s the whole not-working thing. It\u2019s the guilt that I\u2019m not being productive; the worry that I\u2019m wasting time. Part of this anxiety is down to being a freelancer. While there are numerous benefits to being mistress of your own time, paid holiday doesn\u2019t number among them. Being self-employed also makes it hard to say no to work because you\u2019re never certain you\u2019ll get more. But anxiety about unplugging certainly isn\u2019t confined to freelancers; research shows lots of people find taking time off difficult. This is particularly true in the US, where I live; the only advanced economy where workers aren\u2019t guaranteed paid leave. Those who do have paid holiday often don\u2019t take it; a 2017 survey by the careers website Glassdoor found more than half of Americans fail to use all their holiday time, largely because of fear. Fear of getting behind on work; fear of not seeming dedicated enough. Resting-anxiety levels aren\u2019t much better in Britain. A recent survey of more than 1,000 UK workers by the Institute of Leadership &amp; Management found the prospect of a holiday made 73% of workers feel stressed out. And 61% of people felt obliged to work on holiday. It\u2019s sad that so many of us seem to find taking time off traumatic. But it\u2019s not exactly surprising. Technology has made it virtually impossible to ignore our inboxes and take a break. And, on a deeper level, capitalism has conditioned us to value ourselves according to our output. \u201cI produce, therefore I am,\u201d to paraphrase Descartes (who was clearly a slacker). It\u2019s normal and healthy to derive a sense of purpose from work, of course. But the extent to which we worship productivity has become, I think, toxic. Take, for example, an ad campaign by the freelance marketplace platform Fiverr, which ran in New York last year. The campaign, \u201cIn Doers We Trust\u201d, consisted of black-and-white photos of \u201cdoers\u201d, overlaid with \u201cmotivational\u201d headlines. \u201cYou eat a coffee for lunch,\u201d read one poster, featuring a dead-eyed, gaunt young woman. \u201cYou follow through on your follow through. Sleep deprivation is your drug of choice. You might be a doer.\u201d Yeah, maybe, but there\u2019s also a chance you might be malnourished and on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Fiverr\u2019s campaign rightly generated considerable backlash. Nevertheless, the idea we should all be working ourselves to death in order to be worth anything in life is ingrained in our culture. Just look at the amount of productivity porn we are bombarded with. The media are obsessed with daily routines of the rich and famous \u2013 all of whom seem to accomplish more before 4am than I do in a week. You know what I\u2019d really love to see at the bottom of one of these Day in the Life of a Very Busy Very Successful Executive articles? A disclaimer saying: \u201cDo not try this at home.\u201d A footnote pointing out that said CEO, who reads 10 books and runs 10 miles before breakfast, is probably exaggerating and has an army of assistants. A reminder that we\u2019re humans, not goddamn machines. Anyway, I must admit I\u2019m largely writing this for my own benefit because I have just arrived in Mexico on holiday and am feeling anxious about putting the laptop away. Like I said, a problem truly worthy of a tiny violin. And, I reckon, a large glass of mezcal.", "29||Overwatch World Cup: South Korea win gold for third year runningOverwatch World Cup favourites South Korea emerged victorious on Sunday for the third time in a row, despite a round of upsets, including a particularly valiant run from the UK. At Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s Blizzcon convention in Anaheim, California, last weekend, the victors of the group stages battled it out to take the trophy in front of thousands of fans. The team-based shooter game Overwatch matches make for exciting viewing, with two teams of six players battling to attack and defend objectives as a varied cast of characters, each with their own powerful abilities. No two matches are the same, as players choose different strategies in an attempt to get an advantage over their opponents. This variety was especially well showcased this year, leading to nail-biting matches and some surprising outcomes. Turret-building, molten-lava-pouring Swedish hero Torbj\u00f6rn \u2013 previously seldom seen in competitive play \u2013 made surprise appearances in several teams\u2019 lineups. Fans waved flags and signs celebrating their favourite players, hoping that their team\u2019s unorthodox plans would work out \u2013 or that they would be able to adapt quickly in response to their opponents. One of the teams that was best able to capitalise on the element of surprise was the UK, who made it to the semi-finals. There, they faced off against eventual victors South Korea, and had them scrambling to react, holding them to two draws in the best of five format. South Korea eventually won 2-0 to advance to the finals. The UK team can still leave with their heads held high. Before facing off against the Koreans, they had to beat the US in the round of eight, and were not expected to advance. The home team had much more professional experience under their collective belt, whereas just one member of the UK team, Isaac \u201cBoombox\u201d Charles, had competed in this year\u2019s Overwatch league. South Korea certainly showed off their own league experience as they easily beat silver medallists China, looking much more confident than they had in their game against the UK. The Chinese side had been their practice partners in the lead-up to the event, demonstrating the power that unpredictability can play in upsetting teams that usually look formidable. Korean support player Sung-hyeon \u201cJJoNak\u201d Bang won the \u201cmost valuable player\u201d award, which he also achieved during this year\u2019s league season as a member of the New York Excelsior team. He\u2019s famous for his use of the robotic monk hero Zenyatta, who is traditionally expected to help his team using orbs that heal them and cause enemy players to take more damage. However, JJoNak shines by dealing huge amounts of his own damage, regularly outpacing the more aggression-focused characters on his team. China\u2019s silver-medal placement also spells exciting things for the region. In the Overwatch League\u2019s inaugural season, the country\u2019s only team, the Shanghai Dragons, suffered 40 consecutive losses. This excellent result could prove a turnaround, just in time for three new Chinese teams entering the competition next year, representing Hangzhou, Chengdu and Guangzhou. Unfortunately, the UK could not triumph over the Canadian side in the third-place match, and left Blizzcon without the bronze medal. However, the World Cup has been a fantastic showcase for the talent of individual players hoping to advance their careers, and some, like tank player Cameron \u201cFusions\u201d Bosworth, will now be signed to league teams for the second season, which begins in February. The World Cup will return next year, with dozens of teams from across the globe attempting to claim Blizzcon fame and lift the trophy themselves. The UK will likely compete again, but South Korea claim they will remain unbeatable: \u201cWithout cheating, you can\u2019t win,\u201d joked JJoNak after their victory.", "0||Gandhi scholar quits Indian university after nationalist pressureAn Indian biographer of Mahatma Gandhi will no longer teach at a university in the independence leader\u2019s home state after the institute came under pressure from critics including Hindu nationalist student groups complaining his work was \u201canti-national\u201d. Ramachandra Guha, an Indian public intellectual whose works have covered cricket, the environment, contemporary Indian history and the life of Gandhi, had been announced in September as the newest faculty member at Ahmedabad University in Gujarat state. Last week, after a student union affiliated with India\u2019s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party complained about Guha\u2019s appointment, the writer said on Twitter he was no longer joining the university. \u201cDue to circumstances beyond my control, I shall not be joining Ahmedabad University,\u201d he wrote, adding: \u201cMay the spirit of Gandhi one day come alive once more in his native Gujarat.\u201d The Guardian understands the newly established university faced political resistance over the appointment and asked Guha to defer the start of his post until after parliamentary elections, scheduled to take place before May. Since the appointment had already been announced, Guha decided not to take up the post rather than delay its commencement without explanation, sources said. His selection as a professor of humanities had earned the ire of members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a student group affiliated to the ruling party of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. A memorandum penned by the group and addressed to the university\u2019s vice-chancellor said Guha\u2019s work was \u201ccritical of India\u2019s Hindu culture\u201d. \u201cHis such writings have encouraged divisive tendencies, alienation in the name of independence of the individual, freeing terrorists in the name of independence of the individual, and separating Jammu and Kashmir from the Indian union,\u201d they wrote. The ABVP, which claims to have more than 3 million members, has become more prominent on Indian campuses since Modi\u2019s election in 2014, regularly clashing with liberal and leftwing student groups and disrupting events they deem anti-Hindu. Ahmedabad University denied being pressured into any decision by the ABVP. Guha has been critical of the Modi government but also its main opposition, the Congress party. He famously described India as a \u201c50/50\u201d democracy, but two years ago revised the democratic quotient in the Modi era downwards to 40/60. Groups such as PEN International have warned of \u201ca rising tide of violence, impunity, extended pre-trial detentions, and surveillance\u201d in India since Modi was elected, though others, including Guha, have pointed out that previous governments have also shown varying degrees of intolerance to dissent. Yet no government in recent decades has enjoyed the parliamentary majority of Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party nor had its zeal or mission to explicitly reshape the country to put Hinduism at the political and cultural centre. Some prominent commentators reacted with dismay at Guha\u2019s apparent unwillingness or inability to teach in Ahmedabad, the city where Gandhi went to high school and established his base after returning from South Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s come to a stage that an accomplished historian of modern India can no longer teach where he wants to in the country,\u201d wrote Sushil Aaron, a journalist and commentator. Modi\u2019s government has also exercised its right to change the composition of state-funded cultural institutions to include appointments of those closer to its worldview. Last week, it raised eyebrows by appointing the bombastic television host Arnab Goswami to the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library board. Another public intellectual, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, had recently quit the board citing political pressure. A major Delhi institute, Jawaharlal Nehru University, whose vice-chancellor was chosen from a list created by a government agency, last week appointed a Hindu nationalist activist as an honorary professor. Rajiv Malhotra, a former entrepreneur turned writer, has gained a large following for his criticism of Hindu scholars, especially foreign ones, some of who he claims have been driven to studying, and in his view, eroticising aspects of, Hinduism because of repressed sexual desires. His work has earned him a large following among Hindu activists but also scorn from religious scholars, with one theologian at Princeton in the US accusing him of plagiarism and \u201ca lack of academic integrity\u201d.", "6||Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend's action1) Some fouls in the area are more equal than others If a defender attempted a tackle in the area, aimed to take the ball but missed and wiped out a striker, few would argue against a penalty being awarded. That happened twice at the Emirates on Saturday, but rather than an outfield player felling a forward, it was a goalkeeper. In the space of a few minutes both Alisson and Bernd Leno sprinted from their lines and attempted to punch clear a cross, but failed and took out Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Virgil van Dijk respectively. Different rules apply to goalkeepers, awarded fouls when given the slightest touch and forgiven when they commit pseudo-assault. Both incidents were more serious and dangerous than a standard foul from an outfielder: two well-built, 6ft 3in-plus athletes charging at an opponent at speed, and in Leno\u2019s case smashing Van Dijk in the face with a forearm. It is a serious flaw in the rules that neither were penalised. Nick Miller \u2022 Match report: Arsenal 1-1 Liverpool 2) Case growing for Wilson to get England call Callum Wilson\u2019s only previous appearance in an England shirt came in 2014 when he came off the bench to replace Harry Kane in an under-21 friendly against France but after adding to his impressive start to the season with another goal against Manchester United the former Coventry striker deserves another chance to impress Gareth Southgate up close. The 26-year-old was selected by the England manager for that match four years ago when he was still in charge of the youth side so Wilson is clearly on his radar and would certainly offer a different option in attack for the Nations League tie with Croatia next week. The international retirement of Jamie Vardy has created a vacancy in the squad for a striker with genuine pace and Bournemouth\u2019s leading man has shown over the past three seasons that he has the tools required to make an impact at a higher level if he is given the opportunity. Ed Aarons \u2022 Match report: Bournemouth 1-2 Manchester United 3) Rashford and Herrera to the rescue for Mourinho Manchester United\u2019s first-half performance took standards to the lowest point of the season. Their excellent second-half revival to seize a deserved three points showed a way forward, with the pace and directness of goalscorers Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford to the fore. Control of midfield was gained once Rashford and Ander Herrera arrived in the 56th minute in place of Juan Mata and Fred. The latter was United\u2019s key signing of the summer but threatens to go the way of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Eric Bailly, Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Paul Pogba: expensive signings distrusted by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Herrera added bite and haste where previously a trio of Pogba, Fred and Nemanja Matic, costing a combined \u00a3187.8m and all bought under Mourinho\u2019s watch, had been hopeless. John Brewin \u2022 First half was a disaster, says Mourinho 4) Yellow-card \u2018controversy\u2019 plays into idiots\u2019 hands The outcry about Lee Probert\u2019s decision to book Demarai Gray, who had removed his shirt to reveal another garment paying tribute to Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha after scoring Leicester\u2019s winner, seemed a bit much given that there were far more important things going on. Yes, the law might be ill-conceived and yes, it was unfortunate given the emotion of the occasion, but Probert was doing his job and his body language upon seeing Gray\u2019s actions \u2013 visibly wincing and then making as low-key a show of the yellow card as possible \u2013 should be enough to assure anyone that he was acting against his own instincts. Claude Puel and his players agreed afterwards that, much like them, Probert needed to remain professional and that is where it should end. It is not worth the fuss and it is certainly not worth opening Probert up to unnecessary fury in an age where too many idiots have licence to pour invective and sometimes worse. It is far more appropriate to take strength from an ultimately uplifting afternoon than abase oneself over an inconsequential refereeing call. Nick Ames \u2022 Match report: Cardiff 0-1 Leicester 5) Willian and Pedro flourishing under Sarri There is an inevitability about how the focus is drawn towards Eden Hazard\u2019s brilliance at Chelsea. Or, when a striker who once appeared broken scores a brace, the praise is duly dished out for \u00c1lvaro Morata. Yet it was the energy in the hosts\u2019 ranks which saw them eventually overwhelm Crystal Palace, and the likes of Willian and Pedro who personify that dynamism. The Brazilian has now started 11 games in succession, a sequence that surely has to be curtailed for a breather in Belarus this week, and is a player relishing life after Antonio Conte. He would make way for Hazard, but few players have unsettled Aaron Wan-Bissaka as obviously in recent times. Pedro, industrious as much in defence as in attack, is a truly unsung hero, a player whose tireless running eventually grinds opponents down. His finish for the third was emphatic, and reward for an afternoon of endeavour which sums up this side\u2019s approach. Dominic Fifield \u2022 Match report: Chelsea 3-1 Crystal Palace 6) Coleman deserves time to get back to his best Goodison Park was purring after the best Everton display under Marco Silva so far and three quality goals brought an emphatic end to Brighton\u2019s winning run. The only reservation was criticism of S\u00e9amus Coleman\u2019s recent form and the angry response it prompted from the Republic of Ireland captain following his important goal against Chris Hughton\u2019s team. By his own admission Coleman has not hit his usual high level in recent weeks, which is hardly surprising given he was unable to train for over a month due to a stress fracture in his foot. That injury against Wales, coming after last year\u2019s double leg fracture against the same opposition, clearly affected the defender\u2019s fitness but the 30 year old impressed even without his goal on Saturday. Coleman is gradually rediscovering the rhythm that is crucial to his game. If any player deserves a show of that rare commodity in football \u2013 patience \u2013 it is the team captain who embodies commitment to the Everton cause. Andy Hunter \u2022 Match report: Everton 3-1 Brighton 7) Southampton need to put winless streak to bed There is no disgrace in losing at Manchester City but there must be serious alarm in Southampton\u2019s failure to win a Premier League game since 1 September. Despite suffering a 6-1 trouncing at the hands of Pep Guardiola\u2019s men there is hope in the way Saints managed to go at the champions for periods. As Mark Hughes said afterwards: \u201cWe have come up against City, we have created a number of chances again. Our shots on target are right up there in comparison to how clinical Manchester City were today. That has been our story this season. We pick the wrong option or don\u2019t finish the chances we create. We need to improve that and at the back end we need to improve.\u201d Next up are Watford and then a trip to fellow strugglers Fulham. If Saints fail to win either of those then Hughes can expect scrutiny. Jamie Jackson \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 6-1 Southampton 8) Fortune favours Newcastle and Ben\u00edtez at last What are the lessons from Newcastle\u2019s first win of the season? That luck is a hugely underestimated factor in football and post-game analysis is often harshly binary with winning coaches tactical geniuses and losers dunces when, in reality, things could easily have gone either way. If fortune frowned on Watford, Newcastle enjoyed the breaks which have latterly deserted them. \u201cIf you win everyone says \u2018that\u2019s the way\u2019 but, if you do well and lose they say \u2018OK, you\u2019re doing this wrong\u2019,\u201d said a relieved Rafael Ben\u00edtez. \u201cWe knew we needed to win today and if we keep on winning, this will maybe be one of my biggest results [of his career].\u201d Significantly, Ben\u00edtez can seem sceptical about sports psychology but Newcastle\u2019s manager revealed he has recently been reading up on a subject he studied at university as well as consulting the detailed case notes he compiled at previous clubs. Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Newcastle 1-0 Watford 9) Youngster Diangana a revelation for West Ham West Ham\u2019s record signing, Felipe Anderson, delivered a top-class performance in the 4-2 win over Burnley but he was not the only one to do so. Marko Arnautovic thrilled with his power, imagination and skill, while the most exciting display of all came from a 20-year-old graduate of West Ham\u2019s academy, Grady Diangana. The winger, making only his second Premier League start, showed not just trickery and speed but also the wit to thrive on the same wavelength as Arnautovic and Anderson. \u201cHe has great ability,\u201d said West Ham midfielder Robert Snodgrass, who also played well. \u201cWhat I say to these young lads is: \u2018All you\u2019ve got now is a chance \u2013 the same as youngsters coming through other academies \u2013 whether you grab that chance with both hands is up to you. Don\u2019t let it pass you by.\u2019 That\u2019s what Declan [Rice] has done and now Diangana has been given his chance.\u201d So far he has certainly taken it. Paul Doyle \u2022 Match report: West Ham 4-2 Burnley 10) Spurs avoid collapse by the slimmest of margins \u201cIt\u2019s common sense, no?\u201d Mauricio Pochettino said, pointing out that when you play on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday it is prudent to rest players such as Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min and Davinson S\u00e1nchez before PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League adds a fourth game in nine days. Less easy to explain is why Spurs needed to send on three of these players \u2013 Alli was not on the bench \u2013 to see out a game they were winning 3-0 after an hour. It would be a mistake to imagine it was simply the naive defending of the debutant Juan Foyth that led to the two Wolves penalties. Kieran Trippier was at fault too and the whole Spurs backline was at full stretch to resist a pummelling in the closing minutes. Wolves were unlucky, particularly with a wrongly disallowed goal in the first half. Which has to mean Spurs were lucky. They played well but they must still feel they got out of jail.

It is the latest high street retailer to go bust after Evans Cycles, House of Fraser, Toys R Us and Maplin, while a string of other well-known names have shut dozens of stores via an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement. Crawshaw, which was founded in 1954, said it appointed Ernst &amp; Young as administrators on Friday. It shut 35 stores and its distribution centre at Astley, with the loss of 354 jobs. The remaining 19 stores and Crawshaw\u2019s other distribution centre at Hellaby remain open and continue to employ 261 people. The firm is continuing its trial of three butcher\u2019s counters in Spar stores. The administrators have put the business and assets up for sale and have begun talks with interested parties \u201cwith a view to agreeing a sale over the coming weeks\u201d. Crawshaw was forced into administration after several years of losses and the failure to raise more money from shareholders to fund a revamp of the business. Along with other high street retailers, Crawshaw has been hit by rising rents, higher business rates and fragile consumer confidence in the run-up to Brexit. It has also been under pressure from the rise of the discount supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl, which have forced other supermarkets and Crawshaw to cut prices. The company has 42 high street shops and 12 factory outlets across the Midlands and north of England. Of the 19 stores that are still trading, nine are factory stores. Its new chief executive Jim Viggars, who took over in May, had plans to open more of those larger out-of-town shops, with parking, that sell big packs of fresh meat. They are cheaper to open and fit out, and have performed better than the smaller high street stores, which also sell hot food such as whole cooked chickens, pies and filled baguettes. Ranjit Singh Boparan, the entrepreneur known as the \u201cchicken king\u201d, is Crawshaw\u2019s biggest shareholder with a 29.7% stake in the business and is an adviser to the board.

John Mitchell was the All Blacks head coach at the 2003 World Cup but, as England\u2019s new defence coach, now finds himself in charge of halting the game\u2019s most lethal attacking outfit. Buoyed by their narrow win over the Springboks \u2013 the history books will not record that Owen Farrell\u2019s last-gasp hit on Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen should have been a penalty \u2013 England\u2019s new defensive system under Mitchell is being tipped to cause New Zealand problems. \u201cI worked with Mitch a lot at the Bulls and he is going to make a massive difference to them,\u201d predicted the South Africa centre Jesse Kriel. \u201cThey had a lot more line speed, which is what Mitch likes. He will give the guys a lot of confidence and they will get a lot more turnovers.

Should the second-string New Zealand side be lauded for scoring 10 tries or criticised for conceding five? Perhaps best just to celebrate the return to the international stage of Dane Coles, for whom it had been a long time coming. Coles had been sidelined for 12 months after requiring two operations to a knee injury sustained against France last autumn. He has admitted to having doubts as to whether he would return at all and all this after missing out on the 2017 British &amp; Irish Lions series due to series of injury problems. At the peak of his powers he was the world\u2019s best in his position and we can only hope his comeback continues. Gerard Meagher \u2022 Read suggests retirement plans before All Blacks beat Japan 69-31 4) Larmour takes his chance with gusto Jordan Larmour will come up against tougher opponents than Italy this autumn but when compared to \u201ca young Christian Cullen\u201d by the Azzurri head coach and fellow Irishman, Conor O\u2019Shea, it must be considered high praise indeed. Larmour has had to wait in the wings for his first start, winning his first six caps off the bench, but he faced Italy from the off on Saturday in Chicago and crowned the occasion with a hat-trick. He beat 12 defenders in total, making 249 metres, and his third try is well worth a watch. Larmour, still just 21, has been tipped for big things for a while now and he appears poised to deliver this autumn.

We\u2019ve said it before, but if Wales don\u2019t beat Australia this weekend one has to wonder what it will take. Warren Gatland made the reasonable point that they usually start their autumns against a match-hardened southern-hemisphere team. It is also true that there must be something about the way Wales look at the Aussies, because they always seem to encounter them at their best. Or maybe there\u2019s just something about the way Wales play that allows it. Either way, Wales are No 3 in the world. They have had a game under their belt. If not now, when?

If he has a bad day \u2013 and he does have them \u2013 so do Scotland. Duncan Weir may be mounting a comeback at Worcester, but for now Scotland are invested in Adam Hastings as an alternative. He started poorly, missing one penalty to touch and scuffing another loose kick downfield but Gregor Townsend, his coach and predecessor, was most pleased with the way he rode those wobbles. He looked confident at the tee and plays with an elegance more reminiscent of John Rutherford than his father.

The Ministry of Defence is expected to announce on Monday that it will no longer require those joining the armed services from Commonwealth countries such as Australia, India, Canada, Kenya and Fiji to have lived in Britain for five years. Under the policy, recruits will be considered for all forces including the Royal Navy and the RAF, with applications opening in early 2019. It is hoped the changes will lead to an extra 1,350 people joining every year. The army will begin the admissions process from early next year, while the navy and RAF will start immediately. Applications from citizens of countries outside the Commonwealth will not be accepted. \u201cForeign and Commonwealth troops have historically been important and valued sources of recruitment for the British army and I welcome the recruitment limit increase,\u201d Mark Francois, a member of the defence select committee, told the Daily Telegraph, which first published details of the plan. The UK armed forces are short of 8,200 soldiers, sailors and air personnel, a report found earlier this year, the worse shortage since 2010. The government allows 200 Commonwealth citizens who have not lived in Britain for five years to apply, a rule introduced in 2016. But now the cap will be lifted. Special rules already allow citizens of Ireland and Gurkhas from Nepal to join the armed forces. MPs said the move highlighted a crisis in recruitment, taking aim at Capita, the business service provider that runs the army\u2019s recruitment campaign. Francois, who spent a year meeting MoD officials and military personnel, said: \u201cThe army is disappearing before our eyes and will continue to do so until Capita are sacked.\u201d A Capita spokesman said it was confident changes it was introducing would deliver \u201c[better] outcomes for candidates and the army\u201d. Concern was also raised in April\u2019s National Audit Office report that there were \u201cmuch larger shortfalls\u201d in the number of engineers, pilots and intelligence analysts. It said the air force iswas undertaking more missions than it had for a quarter of a century. And a Conservative MP\u2019s report in July 2017 warned that the armed forces were \u201chollowing out\u201d due to recruitment issues. Francois described factors leading to a recruitment crisis as the \u201cperfect storm\u201d, citing high employment rates and an ageing population as reasons behind a fall in numbers. He also said an increase in obesity and a rising proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic people \u2013 who he said had until now been less likely to apply for military service \u2013 were also behind the fall. Francois recommended that attempts be made to attract more black, Asian and minority ethnic recruits, as well as getting more women to join. Last month, it was announced that women would be allowed to apply for all roles in the British military for the first time, including in frontline infantry units and the Royal Marines. New rules mean women will also be able to put themselves forward for selection for specialist units including the SAS and SBS.

The only means of masturbation I have employed since my teens has been clitoral stimulation and have never had a \u201creal\u201d orgasm (I read online about mini-orgasms you can have with clitorial stimulation and it seems a close fit to what I experience). Even though there is no lack of desire between me and my boyfriend, and even though I enjoy everything he does, I never become fully aroused. This compounds the issue of my boyfriend being unable to penetrate me during sex. I can comfortably pass one finger in at best. I tried to use a menstrual cup, but could barely get a tenth of it in. In light of this discovery I feel anxious every time we try to have sex because I know penetration is impossible and I end up losing my drive. Is this normal given my sexual inactivity or is there reason to consult a gynaecologist? Your hymen is probably still more or less intact. Some people have thicker hymens that can be more difficult to break. Check your status with a gynaecologist. There are clinical options for solving such a problem, and in your case that might be better than continuing to experience such fear and discomfort while trying to have intercourse. You have already been suffering from negative psychological effects of what is likely a simple and normal physiological issue to do with first-time penetration \u2013 and it\u2019s time for you to start having sex without so much anxiety. You clearly have high levels of desire and arousal, but it is not easy to have great orgasms when even the thought of penetration makes you anxious and actual attempts produce pain and disappointment.

Some might dismiss it as the show that dragged TV into the gutter, a sign of our degraded society \u2013 but the truth is far more complex. Big Brother was born at a moment of explosive innovation, at the very time the internet was taking shape, and it was the first programme to truly embrace online streaming; you might remember gathering round office computers watching Nasty Nick get his comeuppance at the hands of Craig the builder \u2013 the nation\u2019s first full-scale, ultra-hysterical online shame-on-you moment. As we fast-forward into the social media age, we can see the seeds of our modern screen-based feeding frenzies taking root in that moment. When Big Brother 2 came along we went one step further, streaming the show 24 hours a day on E4 and allowing audiences different platforms through which to consume it. Now we stream everything. All the time. For ever. It was also the first show to give viewers the power to influence what they were watching \u2013 and once that genie was out of the bottle, straightforward voting on evictions soon morphed into viewers calling Ofcom, the press, the RSPCA and the police to try to influence events in the house. And on that notorious fight night, the weight of the audience response almost led to the local police shutting the show down. It almost happened again a couple of years on with Jade and Shilpa. You might not welcome those developments, but they were a reflection of our time rather than the cause of it \u2013 and there are other areas where the impact was definitively positive, especially in relation to inclusivity. Over my 10 years working on the show I had many a row with documentary producers who railed against \u201cso-called reality TV\u201d and asserted their God-given right to be the prism through which all real-life stories were told. I had even more rows with people railing against \u201cthose awful people\u201d we were putting on TV. I thought in their snobbery both missed the point. We always aimed to show the diversity of the UK \u2013 race, class, gender and beyond \u2013 and the likes of Brian, Jade, Pete, Nadia and the rest were largely able to tell their own stories and express their own views unmediated by the eye and the angle of the documentary film-maker. Along the way, the show demonstrated what a tolerant country we can be as we were captivated by Brian\u2019s coming-out story in Big Brother 2 and voted Nadia, who\u2019d transitioned from male to female, the victor in Big Brother 5. And that inclusivity and tolerance remains evident in this final series \u2013 with Cameron struggling to come out (still, in 2018), supported by his straight older brother, then opening up to the housemates and receiving an overwhelmingly positive response. Big Brother can claim, too, to be the first show with a \u201ccelebrity\u201d version, when showing celebrities as \u201creal\u201d people was a bit of a revelation. Who knew Anthea Turner could fold sheets so efficiently or Vanessa Feltz would buckle under pressure, or George Galloway would look so fetching in a leotard? The show can also legitimately lay claim to inventing a new kind of celebrity \u2013 people who now ply their trade appearing on every reality show going. And of course it was a celebrity-eating-itself version of the show that caused the biggest noise of all: when Jade Goody returned as a celebrity in Celebrity Big Brother and met Shilpa Shetty. That led to The Big Brother race row. It was a scary but fascinating moment for all of us, being swept up in a media firestorm, and whatever you think of Jade or Shilpa, or of how we handled the whole affair, I believe it did a positive service to the country and demonstrated the unique power of Big Brother. The row brought to the surface an issue around racially insensitive language, respect and class in conversations that played out beyond the hysteria of much of the media coverage (Jeremy Clarkson calling Jade \u201ca racist, pig-faced waste of blood and organs\u201d, anyone?) in more considered debates in homes across the country. Opening up conversations about relationships, morality, modes of behaviour, what\u2019s right and wrong, what\u2019s good or bad can only be a good thing and Big Brother has done that over the years in spades. Love it or loathe it, its legacy will live on. \u2022 Philip Edgar-Jones was the creative director of Big Brother from 2001 until 2010", "29||Martin Amis on Space Invaders: how games criticism was bornFor decades, Martin Amis\u2019s Invasion of the Space Invaders: An Addict\u2019s Guide to Battle Tactics, Big Scores and the Best Machines \u2013 part anthropological survey of New York\u2019s arcade scene in the early 80s, part video game tips book \u2013 has remained one of the great literary curios of the 20th century. First published in 1982, it has long been out of print; even frayed and spent copies command stratospheric prices on the second-hand market. Despite accusations to the contrary, Amis maintains that he has never disowned the book, which stands awkwardly apart from his novels, screenplays, memoirs and other non-fiction. Still, while preparing this week\u2019s unexpected reissue, the publishers Jonathan Cape discovered that the original files of Invasion of the Space Invaders had been unlovingly lost; the book had to be scanned in and rebuilt, pixel-by-pixel. In doing so, a picture of a lost era emerges, along with a valuable snapshot of early critical thinking about video games. Like Updike on golf, or Foster Wallace on tennis, Amis approaches video games with an enthusiast\u2019s glee, deploying pleading prose that seeks to illuminate the subject\u2019s hold on the writer. \u201cCinematic melodrama blazing on screen, infinite firing capacity, beautiful responsiveness, the background pulse of the quickening heartbeat\u201d \u2013 Amis\u2019s fascination is clear, his enthusiasm infectious. So too is that of Steven Spielberg who, bewilderingly, cameos as the book\u2019s foreword writer, thanking \u201cyoung Martin\u201d (who was actually 33 at the time) for undertaking a \u201chorrific odyssey around the world\u2019s arcades\u201d to warn readers of the risks of game playing before they, too, become \u201cvideo junkies\u201d. On that (ironic) point, Amis instinctively feels that video game playing is a morally ambiguous pursuit. He aligns it with \u201cpornography and its solitary pleasures\u201d. This is a book peppered with cautionary musings about the effects video games might have on young minds \u2013 and, in the case of one young actor Amis refers to, whose obsession with Pac-Man left her with an index finger that \u201clooked like a piece of liver\u201d, their hands too. He references parliamentary debates on the risk posed to young people by amusement arcades, which, even in 1982, had gained indelible associations with truancy and iniquity. Amis is simultaneously aware, however, that there is more going on here than mere onanism. \u201cPerhaps the foul-mouthed arcade youths aren\u2019t just improving geometrical and spatial awareness: they\u2019re searching for the meaning of life,\u201d he ambitiously wonders. Certainly, he believes that the video game\u2019s challenge invites self-improvement, while the emergent plots that play out on the screen crown a player as a storyteller. To contextualise and perhaps justify his new infatuation, Amis invokes the greats of his old infatuation: \u201cAs Kurt Vonnegut said of Cape Kennedy, there is a supercharged, erotic atmosphere in the funfairs of new technology,\u201d he writes. Then: \u201cAs Forster said of the novel, the thing that impels is the desire to know what happens next. Dear me yes: the video game tells me a story.\u201d Amis even goes so far as to liken the \u201cgamer\u201d (one of the first recorded uses of the word) to the philosopher. Both, he writes, \u201cpeak at puberty\u201d. The strangest component of Invasion of the Space Invaders is its second half, where Amis assumes the role of an acerbic/effusive video game critic. The arcade game Frogger is a \u201cdogger\u201d, Donkey Kong a \u201cpoodle\u201d, Centipede \u201clousy\u201d, Tempest a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d, Defender a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d). Weirder still, he becomes a game tipster too, dispensing high-score chasing advice. Here, Amis memorably urges players, when shooting down the shuffling rows of iridescent alien invaders, to \u201cnarrow that phalanx\u201d. The writing occasionally shows its age (or perhaps the age of its writer at the time). Amis urges restraint when shooting apart Asteroids, lest we find ourselves \u201cstoned to death like an Iranian rapist\u201d. For the contemporary reader, however, the book provides a vivid snapshot of the nascent arcade scene in New York, where Amis was living at the time. The \u201cvidkid\u2019s\u201d uniform is \u201cwoolly hat, earphones, windbreaker, jeans, moonboots and a Rubik\u2019s Cube keyring\u201d. Arcades are filled with \u201czonked glueys, swearing skinheads\u2026 seven-foot black kids on rollerskates\u2026 10-year-old trogs (knowing little vandals)\u2026 queasy spivs\u2026 hip Madison Avenue ad execs and MIT whiz-kids, enjoying their coked-up coffee break.\u201d We see \u201ca tubby 10-year-old saunter down the street while zapping a fistful of Space Invaders\u201d on one of the new handheld devices, and learn that the two best Defender cabinets Amis has ever played (\u201cbeautifully exact and responsive\u201d) are to be found at Playland in the Times Square area. Battlezone, a tank-based shooter, a variation of which was used for training by the US Army, he describes with a sociologist\u2019s twinkle as attracting a \u201crelatively middle-class and elderly audience\u2026 intense, thin-lipped characters\u201d. These snapshots are valuable. In the console era, video game players don\u2019t get out as much as they used to. As such, this is a vanished world, one that, in being dismissed at the time as faddish low culture, was poorly recorded. For Amis, too, video games disappeared. Invasion of the Space Invaders was written concurrently to Money, one of the defining novels of the yuppie era. Video games, with their unflinching rules and reassuring strictures provided, seemingly, an escape for the young Amis from the rigours of experimental novel writing. But when the work was finished, so too, apparently, was the infatuation. He never again wrote about games, and today turns down interviews about the book. Amis\u2019s hopeful sense, however \u2013 that the best video games had still to come \u2013 has proven timeless. \u201cOne simply hangs around waiting for the games to get better,\u201d he wrote, a feeling that video gaming\u2019s multitudes of apologists will surely recognise. \u2022 Invasion of the Space Invaders: An Addict\u2019s Guide to Battle Tactics, Big Scores and the Best Machines by Martin Amis is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a314.99).

While it promised \u201cA stronger economy [and] a secure future\u201d, this was too easily scrubbed off and replaced by critics \u2013 who also mocked the debut of a new signature that simply read \u201cScomo\u201d. Then came the hat. Morrison\u2019s awkward new persona was roundly mocked on Monday after he published a video thanking the mother of the Australian surfer Mick Fanning for giving him a new hat. Standing on a beach in a business shirt, Morrison thanked Elizabeth Osborne in a speech that many said was stuffed chock full of too many supposedly true-blue slang terms. \u201cG\u2019day, Elizabeth, Mick Fanning\u2019s mum,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here at the Gold Coast down at Broadbeach and yeah, fair dinkum, we should be supporting Australian businesses, so great to have the Rip Curl hat.\u201d Since he became prime minister in August, Morrison has sported a wide variety of surfing caps and other hats. A previous hat he wore was made by the brand Hurley, which is US-owned. Rip Curl is an Australian company that sponsors Fanning. But commentators quickly derided the video. The comedian and ABC host Charlie Pickering tweeted: \u201cIf I hear him say [fair dinkum] again I will fair dinkum throw up.\u201d Others also pointed out a scandal in 2016 where Rip Curl was found to be using slave labour in North Korea to create its products. Many observed that the prime minister\u2019s awkward, low-quality video style was a conscious political choice by his media team. Morrison has previously tweeted praise for a parody by the ABC\u2019s 7.30 that suggested they were supposed to \u201clook like fucking shit\u201d.", "23||Leslie Jamison picks the best books to understand drinkingThe literary accounts of drinking that have meant the most to me aren\u2019t the ones whose stories are lit in neon, full of sprawling hijinks and outrageous blunders, but the ones that capture how lonely it can become. They aren\u2019t chronicles of the way many people can drink, but stories that have made me feel less alone in the way I used to drink: desperately, repetitively, often gracelessly, delivered constantly back into the dingy storeroom of the self. Perhaps a deepening awareness of this kind of drinking is part of why more young people are choosing not to drink at all. These books are often dark, but there is something generous in their honesty \u2013 never promising salvation, just some solace. The grimly self-destructive antiheroine of Jean Rhys\u2019s Good Morning, Midnight holes herself up in a Paris apartment with \u201cthe bright idea of drinking herself to death\u201d, and the novel is clear-eyed about the numbing claustrophobia of drinking. It\u2019s also canny about the spectacle of drunk weeping \u2013 the way no one wants to be bothered by a melodramatic lush \u2013 and it\u2019s surprisingly funny: people keep offering this woman coffee and cocoa, but she knows what she wants. James Welch\u2019s novel Winter in the Blood is set on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in central Montana, and its atmosphere is humid with booze: a woman\u2019s teeth gone green from cr\u00e8me de menthe, a purple teddy bear on a bar stool, the wine-stained butterflies on a dress. The novel comes at trauma with the spare, lyric voice of a narrator whose understatement testifies to what Louise Erdrich calls \u201cthe modesty of his despair\u201d. It\u2019s an exploration of the ways we can feel far away from our own lives \u2013 how memory can feel more immediate than the present, or how, as the narrator puts it: \u201cI was as distant from myself as a hawk from the moon.\u201d Billie Holiday\u2019s memoir, Lady Sings the Blues, is a searing account of her life as a brilliant artist, a heroin addict, simultaneously worshipped as a siren of sorrow and persecuted by a legal system structured by systemic racism. Booze runs like a glimmering ribbon through these pages \u2013 she even makes moonshine from potato peelings while incarcerated \u2013 but Holiday emerges as a figure far more nuanced and human than her mythic image. In one memorable scene, she cooks red beans and hamburger meat \u2013 out of cans, heated with steno fuel \u2013 for the entire staff of her London hotel. It was only after I\u2019d done a lot of drinking \u2013and eventually got sober \u2013 that I realised how much Stephen King\u2019s horror classic The Shining, a novel that seems to be about a man\u2019s breakdown in a haunted hotel, is actually about drinking. The protagonist is a dry drunk who relapses (either physically or spiritually, it\u2019s never entirely clear) when a ghost-bartender serves him a long row of whiskey shots at the deserted bar; and the novel explores what happens when longing isn\u2019t reckoned with, only suppressed; how anger and nostalgia can combine forces in toxic ways. After nearly eight years sober, I read Kaveh Akbar\u2019s poetry collection Calling a Wolf a Wolf, and it was like a bright flash of lightning illuminating the landscape of craving. The poems are full of savage, funny, tender articulations of thirst \u2013 indeed, articulating thirst is one of their core projects. \u201cIf I called a wolf a wolf,\u201d the speaker thinks, \u201cI might dull its fangs.\u201d The nerve-endings of these poems are open to despair, delight and bafflement all at once: \u201cSome people don\u2019t even want to drink,/ aren\u2019t tempted by the pools of liquor / all around them. This seems / a selfishness. God loves the hungry / more than the full.\u201d The Recovering by Leslie Jamison is published by Granta.

Perhaps you\u2019d even be living there. You\u2019d also have heard of its chief designer: Athelstan Spilhaus. The sci-fi name sounds too on-the-nose to be true, but Spilhaus was real and so, for a time, was his utopian brainchild \u2013 at least on paper. Originally from South Africa, by way of MIT, Spilhaus was a postwar polymath in the vein of Buckminster Fuller. He seems to have been an expert in everything from engineering to urban planning to atmospheric science to oceanography. And, like Fuller, he believed that science and technology could solve most of humankind\u2019s problems. If we could send a human into space, we could do anything. Spilhaus proposed such solutions weekly in his future-science comic-strip series Our New Age, which was widely syndicated in US newspapers from 1957 to 1973. Getting such visions off the paper turned out to be a different story, but an instructive one, as told in new documentary The Experimental City, directed by Chad Freidrichs. South African-American geophysicist and oceanographer Athelstan Spilhaus in 1962. Photograph: CBS via Getty Images Looking at projections in the early 60s, Spilhaus saw that the US population was set to grow to 400 million by the 21st century, which translated into the equivalent of building 12 new cities of 250,000 people annually. This was in an era when existing cities were dying \u2013 blighted by crime, urban decay and \u201cwhite flight\u201d to the suburbs. So in true postwar visionary style, Spilhaus rethought the entire concept of the city from first principles. He called it a \u201ctotal systems experiment\u201d. In proposing his prototype 21st-century city, Spilhaus correctly diagnosed many of the shortcomings of the 20th-century one. He cottoned on early to concepts such as air pollution, even speculating that it was changing the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. He focused on the problem of waste, noting that prosperity in 1950s and 60s America was being measured in terms of consumption, and suggesting that \u201cwaste is a resource that we don\u2019t yet know how to use\u201d. In his city, everything would be recycled. He questioned the amount of urban space given over to roads, and proposed that the city of the future be free of the internal combustion engine, or at least that cars be integrated into a \u201cdual-mode\u201d guideway \u2013 whereby automobiles come off the road and on to a guided rail-like system that moves them around the city independent of the drivers. All of this infrastructure \u2013 transport, utilities, parking, air-pollution removal technology \u2013 could be built underground, leaving clear civic space at ground level. Spilhaus even anticipated that people would have personal computers in their homes one day, which they would use for shopping and education. Spilhaus loved the mechanics of systems \u2013 but he was no architect. Photographs: Ron Galella/WireImage/Unicorn Stencil Doc Films Minnesota Experimental City, or MXC, began in earnest in 1966, when Spilhaus found a powerful ally in the form of Otto Silha, publisher of the Minnesota Star and Tribune. Their joint PR campaign brought on other well-connected advocates: a four-star general; president Johnson\u2019s physician; civil rights leader Muriel Snowden; even Fuller himself (at one point MXC was to be covered in a giant glass geodesic dome, like the one Fuller had proposed putting over Manhattan in 1960). With the support of vice-president Hubert Humphrey, a former Minnesota senator, MXC received some $250,000 of federal funds in 1967. Corporations including Boeing, Ford and Honeywell pledged to invest. The total cost of the project was estimated at $10bn, completion date: 1984. The devil was in the details. Judging by Freidrichs\u2019s documentary, which makes use of personal interviews and audio of the MXC board\u2019s meetings (you can almost smell the whiskey-breath and cigarette smoke), there was little meat on the bones. We see broad-brush schematics of the city\u2019s organisation, even including \u201cpersonal flying zones\u201d to accommodate jet-belt commuters. But there is precious little consideration given to, say, the provision of an actual civic space where people would want to live. At one point, the MXC was to be covered in a giant glass geodesic dome. Image: Unicorn Stencil Doc Films Dedicated town-planning, let alone architecture, is very thin on the ground \u2013 the idea presumably being that planners and architects would come in later and be free to do their thing. Spilhaus loved the mechanics of systems but he was no architect. One drawing of the projected city even features a nuclear power station right in the middle of town. Spilhaus had no problem with that \u2013 this was the future, dammit! As MXC became bogged down in committee-level decision-making and real-world challenges, and Spilhaus\u2019s control diminished, he seemed to lose patience. He resigned as MXC co-chairman in 1968, although he continued to champion the project. Hubert Humphrey\u2019s defeat by Richard Nixon in the 1968 presidential election was another blow, but still the MXC project ploughed on. They found a site: an area of swampland in Swatara, central Minnesota, whose chief virtue seemed to be that hardly anybody lived there. Those who did weren\u2019t exactly taken with the idea of a 250,000-person city on their doorstep, with or without the nuclear power station. \u201cSome of the people in Swatara were incredulous that the state would think about taking their property, taking their land and creating this futuristic monstrosity,\u201d recalls Grant Merritt, former head of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Clockwise from top : the futuristic city logo; a protest by Swatara residents and the isolated woodland location chosen for the city. Photographs: Unicorn Stencil Doc Films \u201cThis was something based on a comic strip \u2026 and I was not too keen on that kind of a city.\u201d Merritt became a leader of the David-v-Goliath campaign against MXC, fuelled by a burgeoning environmental movement that had begun to see technology as the problem rather than the solution. In the winter of 1972, activists braved sub-zero conditions to march from Swatara to the state capitol in Saint Paul, some 160 miles away. Spilhaus dismissed the environmentalists as \u201ca body of uninformed, vocal opinion which one might characterise as supporting non-engineering or even anti-engineering\u201d, and urged the state legislature to stand firm against their \u201cnonsense emotionalism\u201d. But it was to no avail. In 1973, MXC was officially defunded and wound down. MXC exhibits many of the same flaws as other failed utopian schemes of the era. For one thing, it was the vision of one very determined and somewhat arrogant man. Spilhaus, who died in 1998, never seemed to like the idea of collaboration or relinquishing control \u2013 this was his baby. In later life, he suggested building the city underwater, where those pesky protesters couldn\u2019t jeopardise it. For another, MXC never even approached the stage of dealing with the practical challenges of realising such a vision, which is probably just as well. Who knows how many cost overruns, technical barriers, engineering disasters and other reality checks it would have faced? It might have all gone swimmingly, but it seems doubtful. Does the failure of MXC suggest that blank-slate utopias are not the answer, and never will be, or that society has become too timid about big, bold solutions? With the current global fashion for building entire cities from scratch as a way to fix the problems of our unsustainable urban lives, there\u2019s plenty to learn from Spilhaus\u2019s grand, ultimately fruitless vision. Even failed experiments have their value. \u2022 The Experimental City will be screening at Curzon Bloomsbury, London, on 8 November.

However, about four years ago I bought a flat with my daughter which she lives in and which I also used when working away from home. We are planning to sell the flat next year. But until we do, I am worried that I will have to pay a higher rate of stamp duty land tax on our new home. AA A Because you are replacing your old main residence with a new main residence within three years of selling your old home, you won\u2019t have to pay the higher rate of stamp duty land tax (SDLT) even though you jointly own a flat with your daughter. If you had bought your new home before selling your old one, you would have had to pay the higher rates. But you would also have been able to claim a refund provided you managed to sell the old one within three years of buying the new one. Following a tinkering with the rules for SDLT refunds in last Monday\u2019s budget papers, you now have 12 months from selling your old home to make a successful reclaim or a year from the date you paid the higher rates of SDLT on the new home, whichever comes later.", "19||Can you solve it? Gunpowder, reason and plotHi guzzlers, Today\u2019s puzzle concerns the Gunpowder Plot, in which Guy Fawkes and pals attempted to burn down the Houses of Parliament on this day in 1605. In an incident as yet unreported by historians, six men were rounded up by the authorities on suspicion of being traitors. By chance the men had alphabetically consecutive names. Already very suspicious! The investigating officer took each of them aside and questioned them in private about the others. They made the following remarks. Augustine: Felix is loyal, Erasmus is a traitor. Bartholomew: Augustine is loyal. Cuthbert: Felix is loyal, Bartholomew is a traitor. Dionisius: Cuthbert is loyal, Bartholomew is a traitor. Erasmus: Dionisius is a traitor. Felix: Augustine is loyal. It was known that loyalists tell the truth as far as they know it, so their comments about traitors can be trusted, but not their comments about loyalists. Traitors, on the other hand, know who is one of their own and who isn\u2019t, and will always give false information. How many traitors are there? I\u2019ll be back at 5pm UK with the answer and an explanation. UPDATE: To read the solution click here.

That\u2019s the question that is a frequent topic of conversation at Westminster, particularly among Labour MPs of a New Labourish persuasion. Although some are open to the idea of splitting away, most are opposed, though there is a small but influential cadre of New Labour alumni who are willing to bend their ears about the benefits of a split. One of those privately and publicly advocating for some kind of new party is Philip Collins, formerly Tony Blair\u2019s speechwriter and now ensconced at the Times as a columnist. Start Again is Collins\u2019s attempt to persuade readers that a new party is necessary, desirable and to provide a ready-made agenda for such a movement. To do so, Collins dips into one of the more dubious literary traditions \u2013 that of the mid-career politician\u2019s book: written not at the end of a political journey but at the start; a way to improve the profile of a middle-ranking minister or the senator of an obscure state to facilitate their bid for a bigger job. Start Again faithfully follows this type: halfway between memoir and manifesto, with an anecdote about his mother teaching him to read using the Times employed as an argument for the expansion of early years\u2019 spending. There are a few examples of the genre that manage to lift themselves beyond the lamentable: Start Again, regrettably, isn\u2019t one of them. The central thesis is that the two big political parties are in a terrible mess: the Conservatives have \u201cdragged the nation into its own private feud\u201d over Brexit, while Labour, beset by antisemitism, anti-capitalism and anti-Americanism, is \u201cno longer a noble institution\u201d. As for the Liberal Democrats, their brand is \u201cfatally tarnished\u201d and they should give up and shut up shop. Collins then proceeds to set out a number of areas in which the two parties are failing and suggests ways in which a new movement could \u201cstart again\u201d and offer something new. The proposals include, in no particular order, a radical increase in the amount of money spent on early years; a rebalancing of the welfare state to favour the working young; a significant increase in inheritance tax; a shift in British taxation away from income and towards wealth; that the House of Lords be replaced with a proportionally elected chamber; and that voting be made compulsory and the franchise extended to 16- and 17-year-olds. The problem, which will be clear to anyone who has taken the time to study the manifestos put forward by our two, apparently decaying, major parties, is that much of this is in the Labour manifesto. Collins\u2019s big and radical plan for a lifetime cap on the amount that people can receive in financial transfers from their families is almost word for word identical to that proposed by the IPPR, once a generator of Blairite ideas and now doing the same thing for Jeremy Corbyn. Towards the close of Start Again, Collins grandly claims that the ideas contained in the book are \u201chard to classify\u201d on the left-right spectrum, but this isn\u2019t true. They are, almost exclusively, policy proposals from the left and centre-left. The only policy proposal that wouldn\u2019t fit comfortably within a speech from John McDonnell is that university technical colleges be expanded. University technical colleges consistently trail all other types of school on every measure, which is why so few people in either of our major political parties are willing to defend them. Collins airily dismisses the Liberal Democrats out of hand as too \u201ctarnished\u201d to be worth bothering with, but the book resembles nothing so much as a Liberal Democrat pamphlet from the pre-coalition days: there are a number of elegant solutions that sit well at the end of a column, supposedly neglected by big political parties out of ideological torpor or cowardice, but there is no real attempt to engage with the policy trade-offs that his schemes would involve. He writes that to govern is to choose, but the difficult decisions are all deferred. In the case of the United Kingdom\u2019s membership of the European Union, Collins writes that Brexit is a mistake but one we\u2019re committed to; he doesn\u2019t allow this to intrude on his thoughts about what that means for the rest of his policy proposals. Climate change, an area in which both major parties have truly lamentable positions, scarcely merits a mention in the book. The tragedy is that the question of what the \u201cpolitically homeless\u201d should do deserves a deeper and more thoughtful analysis than it receives here. Start Again? I wish he had.

The generally serious-minded BFI is looking to rectify that with its annual winter retrospective season. Previous editions have been thematically devoted to gothic, romance and black cinema, but Comedy Genius \u2013 in an elastic range of modes and styles \u2013 is the focus of this year\u2019s, running the gamut from the Marx brothers to Girls Trip. For those who can\u2019t get to the cinema, however, the ever-improving BFI Player has its own pleasingly diverse range of comedy options, some obvious (it\u2019s not like you need another outlet through which to view Bridesmaids, but there it is just in case), but many significantly harder to find in the streaming universe. Best of all is a surprisingly expansive collection of entirely free-to-stream material, much of which is entirely new to me. A hit-and-miss roundup of 60 shorts and features from the archives of British comedy, many of them unearthed from the silent era, it\u2019s ideal for grazing and sampling, offering a fair overview of the genre\u2019s evolution in the process. Many of the discoveries offer more curiosity value than belly laughs. Take The Perfect Woman, a 1949 battle-of-the-sexes farce from the Rank vault in which a mad scientist creates an idealised robo-femme, with inevitably chaotic results. It\u2019s spry, and gamely performed, but most valuable now as a distillation of another era\u2019s loopy gender politics \u2013 at once retrograde and making awkward lunges at modernity. As dated but more breezily fun is Kate Plus Ten, a kicky Edgar Wallace adaptation from 1938 featuring delicious US star Genevieve Tobin as a mob leader attempting to relieve a speeding train of its golden cargo. And the most guaranteed laughs tend to come in short form. Most winningly silly of all is Miranda, a popular British smash from 1948 that now plays as Splash with a stiff upper lip. Starring Glynis Johns as a flirty mermaid brought ashore to London, it\u2019s a gossamer romp that boasts one immortal closing credit: \u201cTail by Dunlop\u201d. If you\u2019re choosier and less curio-inclined, the BFI Player\u2019s rentals and subscription sections each have a rich, less obscure comic menu on offer. Rentals account for the most expected selections, from The Big Lebowski and the eternally fizzy The Lady Eve. Subscribers can sample the most lateral and international choices from the season. Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s perverse dysfunctional-family allegory Dogtooth isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s idea of a rib-tickler, but Ealing\u2019s original Whisky Galore! is a safer, tiddlier choice. The dreamily bonkers erotic-musical-farcical-whatsit of Tsai Ming-liang\u2019s The Wayward Cloud, meanwhile, lies somewhere endearingly in between. Any menu that includes both V\u011bra Chytilov\u00e1\u2019s dada feminist freakout Daisies and Joanna Hogg\u2019s melancholic botched-holiday study Unrelated is out to open debate about what comedy is, and what its rules, if any, are. Finally, moving away from the BFI Player, a mention for a genre-spinning, black-comic action rattler for which British viewers have been waiting an unaccountably long time. For five years, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s English-language debut, the odd, propulsive, cult-forming Snowpiercer, has been denied either a cinema or a home entertainment release in the UK, but has at last surfaced legally on iTunes. Its arrival, however late, is at least timely. Its dystopian vision of human society confined entirely on one massive, viciously class-divided speed train under the tyrannical rule of Tilda Swinton\u2019s Thatcher-like harpy is a rather more immediate political allegory for far-right separatism now than it seemed in 2013. Maybe try it before heading over to the Comedy Genius season; after watching it you\u2019ll want a laugh. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week The Other Side of the Wind (Netflix) Orson Welles\u2019s troubled, long-in-limbo final film has been impressively patched together for a Netflix release. A heaving, rolling, nightmarish Hollywood satire, it\u2019s part mesmerising, part mess. Leave No Trace (Sony, 12) One of the year\u2019s great American films, this earthy survivalist stunner (right) from director Debra Granik expands richly on the rural canvas she explored so successfully in Winter\u2019s Bone, with even more stirring results. Faces Places (Curzon Artificial Eye, 12) Whisper it soft, in light of the recent Agn\u00e8s Varda revival, but this jaunty country travelogue is an over-precious trifle by the standards of her best work. First Reformed (Universal, 15) A comeback few expected from Paul Schrader, this taut, morally tangled ecclesiastical drama offers Ethan Hawke one of his best roles as a Protestant priest staring faith in the face. Adrift (Sony, 12) A surprisingly involving true-life romance on the high seas, carried by a grand sense of seasick spectacle and committed performances by Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin.", "26||Should Paraguay invest its energy wealth in bitcoin \u2018mining\u2019 or fighting poverty?Shotgun-toting guards patrol an anonymous warehouse on the outskirts of Ciudad del Este. Perched on the triple border where Paraguay meets Brazil and Argentina, the melting-pot city is often associated with smuggling, cartels and drugs. But inside, a new hot commodity is piling up by the second. Dozens of dismantled CPUs and internet-connected circuits whirr away in the gloom, LEDs flashing, adding to the subtropical heat. They are just a few of an estimated 20,000 units citywide, mostly mining the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum in an industry that has sprung up almost overnight. Behind the boom is the monolithic Itaip\u00fa dam the country shares with Brazil, stretching across the Paran\u00e1 river just north of the city. It is the world\u2019s most powerful hydroelectric facility, and its abundant energy supply makes Paraguay an ideal setting for bitcoin \u201cmining\u201d. Itaip\u00fa is enriching some. But the increasingly complicated computations that underpin bitcoins need ever-more powerful computers and cooling systems \u2013 which consume more and more power. And many argue Paraguay could better use its abundant hydroelectric energy to help the quarter of the population that currently live in poverty. According to World Bank figures, Paraguay has the highest level of inequality in land ownership in the world. \u201cSome people have become multimillionaires,\u201d said Gregorio Bareiro, whose first contact with the bitcoin industry came last September, when his air-conditioning business began providing bitcoin investors with a DIY cooling system involving damp cardboard and industrial fans. Now, he rents out 750 computers of his own \u2013 mainly to Brazilians, Europeans and North Americans \u2013 hires a dozen staff, and has plans to install mobile mines in portable trailers. \u201cParaguay today is the only place where there\u2019s abundant energy,\u201d Bareiro enthused. \u201cWe can become the centre of global bitcoin mining.\u201d Paraguay owns half of Itaip\u00fa\u2019s output. But its few factories and creaking national grid can barely absorb all this power, and it is forced to sell the huge surplus to Brazil \u2013 at well below market price, experts claim. This surfeit of power means its domestic energy prices are around 5c per kilowatt hour \u2013 barely a fifth of that of the giant next door \u2013 prompting an influx of foreign-owned factories and investors in recent years. Paraguay should roll out the red carpet further to cryptocurrency miners, said Bareiro. The entrepreneur thinks that by using Itaip\u00fa\u2019s power to cut energy prices further, the owners of the 150,000 units currently in China can be tempted to decamp to Paraguay. \u201cIn 10 years, it would generate enough money to pay Paraguay\u2019s external debt,\u201d he suggested. \u201cWith our resources, we ought to have electric helicopters, drones for transporting goods \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019ve found a way out for our country,\u201d he added. \u201cThe best chance we have is not selling our energy to Brazil but investing in cryptocurrency.\u201d Not everyone is convinced that the energy-guzzling commodity is the way forward. A growing coalition of Paraguayan politicians, academics and businesspeople wants the country to seize looming negotiations with Brazil over the dam\u2019s financial dividends \u2013 due by 2023 \u2013 to spread the benefits of Itaip\u00fa\u2019s bounty more widely. According to Gerardo Blanco, director of a research group on energy at the Universidad Nacional de Asunci\u00f3n, \u201c2023 represents a unique opportunity for Paraguay.\u201d A study by the group suggests that directing the energy currently sold abroad into domestic manufacturing could generate 2m jobs and quadruple Paraguay\u2019s GDP, transforming the destiny of one of South America\u2019s poorest countries. \u201cThis would be a quantum leap that will have huge implications for society, the economy, and even our culture,\u201d Blanco added. Cristine Folch of Duke University similarly suggested that Paraguay could provide data centres powered by clean energy for software giants like Google, Apple and Facebook, and become a regional hub for the manufacture of lithium batteries. If the country takes advantage of Itaip\u00fa now, while its population is still small, \u201cit could put Paraguay on the edge of the technological frontier,\u201d she told the Guardian. Miguel Carter, a Paraguayan development expert, suggested that by negotiating a fairer price for its energy, Paraguay could better fund hospitals and schools and resurrect Paraguay\u2019s rusting railways. According to Carter\u2019s calculations, Paraguay was outgunned by Brazil in negotiating the 1973 Itaip\u00fa treaty \u2013 signed between two dictatorships \u2013 and cheated out of an astonishing $57.7bn in lost income. In 1979, Brazil\u2019s military regime murdered its ambassador to Paraguay to prevent him from revealing the billions of dollars of kickbacks involved in Itaip\u00fa\u2019s construction, it was officially confirmed in October. \u201cWhen I saw the numbers I burst into tears,\u201d Carter told the Guardian. \u201cI know of so many stories of Paraguayans going to hospital and losing their loved ones \u2026 there would have been lives saved, kids with a decent education. You could have had a different country.\u201d A spokesperson for Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry rejected the idea that Paraguay had been swindled, pointing to previous Brazilian concessions and stating that the country had secured and guaranteed the shared debt used to finance Itaip\u00fa\u2019s construction. Brazil\u2019s president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, who takes office in January, is likely to prove a fierce adversary in the negotiations. But some are daring to hope that Paraguay\u2019s energy riches might soon be leveraged to help them. Several hours north on the highway, and an hour down a dirt track, 43 indigenous Ava Guaran\u00ed families of the Tekoha Sauce community live in tarpaulin shacks, sandwiched between fields of soybean and a polluted tendril of the Paran\u00e1, close to the border with Brazil. They lack clean water, healthcare \u2013 and electricity. Chemical run-off from the nearby fields has given many skin complaints. They returned here in 2015, after being forced off their land by the dam\u2019s rising floodwaters in the late 1970s. Soon after, a police raid tore up their crops and burned their houses, school and church. \u201cIf there\u2019s another eviction we\u2019ll stay and die,\u201d said Amada Mart\u00ednez, a community leader. \u201cBecause we have nowhere else to go.\u201d They are now in talks to secure title to a fraction of their ancestral territory. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s a marvel,\u201d Mart\u00ednez added. \u201cBut the damage Itaip\u00fa caused to our people \u2026 behind the story, there\u2019s suffering.\u201d", "16||Seven ways to address insomniaSort out your bedroom Your bedroom is for sleep, right?* So stop using it as your living room. It is your sanctuary: keep it tranquil and dark. Your body needs darkness to release melatonin, which in turn helps you sleep \u2013 so invest in blackout blinds or an eye mask. Switch off mobile phones and computer screens, as their LED screen blue light is particularly unhelpful for melatonin production. If you need a new mattress, spend time choosing one that is appropriate, and make sure your duvet is the right tog for the season. *Sex is also good. An orgasm last thing can help you nod off. Stick to a regular bedtime routine The buzz phrase is sleep hygiene, meaning don\u2019t do anything during the day that might inhibit your sleep later on, and slow down at bedtime. So avoid naps, and go to bed and get up at roughly the same time each day. Enjoy your night-time routine: have a hot bath (it raises your body temperature, which helps you nod off), switch off your devices at least 40 minutes before you turn in, read a book, play soothing music or listen to a \u201cnodcast\u201d. Watch what you eat and drink Alcohol can interfere with your sleep cycle \u2013 it helps you sleep initially, but wakes you up a few hours later. Avoid big meals in the evening, especially rich, heavy or spicy foods that can cause heartburn and stomach trouble. Don\u2019t drink coffee after lunchtime \u2013 2017 research found caffeine reduces your sleep time and quality. Don\u2019t check the clock Part of what keeps us awake at night is stress about being awake. So resist the temptation to clock-watch, which can make you anxious: instead, luxuriate in feeling comfortable, safe and warm. Revisit happy memories and tell yourself that you will still function fine tomorrow. If you really can\u2019t sleep, get up If you often lie awake for more than half an hour, either when you first go to bed or if you wake in the night, get up and make yourself comfortable somewhere else with a book or some music. Return to bed when you feel tired \u2013 this will help you associate bed with sleep and not with wakefulness. Get the Sleepio App Available on the NHS if you live in Thames Valley, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire or Oxfordshire, Sleepio is a digital programme based on cognitive behavioural therapy that helps you discover your ideal personal sleep pattern. Designed to help reduce dependence on sleeping pills, research has shown it can help more than 75% of insomnia sufferers achieve normal sleep. Keep a sleep diary Record your sleep habits over a fortnight: when you go to bed, how long it takes you to sleep, whether you wake in the night. Look for patterns you can change \u2013 maybe you sleep best when you\u2019ve exercised. A sleep diary can also help a doctor pinpoint what\u2019s wrong. If all else fails, get checked out: insomnia is linked with depression, and for some people sleep disruption is an early sign. This article was amended on 6 November 2018. The original said that the Sleepio app was available on the NHS \u201cif you live in the home counties\u201d. In fact, it is only offered by the NHS if you live in Thames Valley: Berkshire, Buckinghamshire or Oxfordshire. The original also suggested the app was available to buy online, but this is no longer the case.", "7||Second parliamentary committee calls for means-tested student grants to be reinstatedPressure is growing on the government to reverse its scrapping of maintenance grants in England, after a second influential parliamentary committee called for financial support for disadvantaged students to be reinstated. The call by the House of Commons\u2019 education select committee will add to the ongoing debate on high levels of student debt and tuition fees in England, as rumours swirl over a possible cut in undergraduate fees to \u00a36,500 being considered by a panel set up by Theresa May. Means-tested student grants were abolished in 2016 and replaced by income-contingent loans to cover living expenses. But the education committee is urging the government to bring them back to encourage disadvantaged students to enrol at university. \u201cBased on the overwhelming evidence we have heard during the inquiry, we recommend that the government return to the pre-2016 system and reinstate the means-tested system of loans and maintenance grants,\u201d the committee concluded in its report into value for money in higher education. The latest report follows a similar conclusion by the House of Lords\u2019 economic affairs committee, which found England\u2019s system of loans to be unfair and called for the previous mix of means-tested grants and loans be revived. The Commons\u2019 committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Robert Halfon, said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the fall in part-time and mature learners, and the impact on the socially disadvantaged going into higher education, since undergraduate tuition fees were raised to \u00a39,000 in 2012. Halfon said that while many British universities were world-class, changes were needed to improve the experience for students. \u201cThe blunt reality is that too many universities are not providing value for money and that students are not getting good outcomes from the degrees for which so many of them rack up debt,\u201d Halfon said. \u201cToo many institutions are neither meeting our skills needs or providing the means for the disadvantaged to climb the ladder of opportunity.\u201d Earlier research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that the increase in tuition fees and the subsequent scrapping of maintenance grants led to students from the poorest backgrounds graduating with debts of more than \u00a357,000. The education committee highlighted experts labelling the decision to scrap grants as \u201cdisastrous\u201d, while the Sutton Trust \u2013 which campaigns to widen access to education \u2013 has repeatedly called for maintenance grants to be reinstated to cut student debt by 75% for students from poorer backgrounds. Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group of research-intensive universities, said the MPs\u2019 report was a \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d to the debate on higher education funding. \u201cThe report is right to emphasise the importance of outreach work with local schools, colleges and communities to widen access to higher education,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe have also been calling for the reintroduction of targeted maintenance grants for students from low income backgrounds as part of a sustainable funding system for higher education.\u201d Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary, said the government \u201cshould start by matching Labour\u2019s commitment to bring back maintenance grants, to ensure that everyone \u2013 whatever their background \u2013 can succeed at university.\u201d While the Department for Education\u2019s research suggests that grants made little difference in encouraging poor students, the issue is also being considered as part of a report into tertiary funding set up by May. The review, headed by Philip Augar, is also to consider controversial issues such as forcing universities to charge differential fees based on course costs, as well as cutting the way interest is charged on the current system of loans. The BBC has reported that vice-chancellors fear the review is considering a cut in tuition fees to \u00a36,500, with higher fees for more expensive courses. Universities are pushing back against the possibility, saying that tuition fee cuts would only benefit the most well-off students and harm social mobility. The MPs also issued strongly worded recommendations on the controversy over high pay for vice-chancellors, executives and senior academic posts, to be backed by the higher education regulator, the Office for Students. \u201cUnjustifiably high pay for senior management in higher education has become the norm rather than the exception,\u201d the report states. The MPs said universities should regularly publish the pay and benefits awarded to their vice-chancellors, and backed a ban on vice-chancellors sitting on the internal committees that set their pay. However, many universities have already agreed to adopt a voluntary code that includes a ban on vice-chancellors sitting on remuneration committee.", "0||Papua New Guinea moves sick refugees from Port Moresby to Manus before Apec summitPapua New Guinean authorities have flown more than 20 refugees from Port Moresby to Manus Island, including some who were receiving ongoing medical treatment in the capital, in the lead-up to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference. The move comes as the Catholic Bishops Conference of PNG called for Australia to take all refugees out of the country by Christmas. About 70 asylum seekers and refugees, part of the cohort sent to PNG by Australia\u2019s offshore immigration system, have been in Port Moresby for medical treatment which was unavailable on Manus Island. But late last week and on Saturday some 50 were told by authorities that they had to leave before the Apec conference because the Pacific International hospital needed to be able to treat delegates and conference employees. Guardian Australia has confirmed that PNG police assisted in the transfer of two groups from the Granville hotel, believed to include about 16 people on Friday and a further seven on Saturday. An employee said some had audibly objected to leaving. Fewer than 20 were left at the hotel, the employee said. As many as 10 of the men had not finished their treatment, Guardian Australia has been told, and they said they had been informed they would be returned in a month to continue it. One man attempted suicide on Wednesday after he was told he would be sent back to Manus without treatment. There are still about 650 men on Manus Island, living in purpose-built accommodation after the detention centre was cleared out last year. Mental and physical illness are rife and acts of violence continue. Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish Iranian journalist and one of the refugees on Manus, said it was worsening. In the past week there had been at least two suicide attempts and three instances of self-harm, he said. Some men \u2013 particularly those separated from their families \u2013 were despairing, he said, as the Australian government said it would get all children and their families off Nauru by the end of the year, while no action was being taken to assist the men in PNG. The PNG Catholic Bishops Conference has called for Australia to resettle them all before Christmas, Radio New Zealand reported on Monday. \u201cPNG as a country itself cannot handle its issues for its own people,\u201d said the bishops conference secretary, Father Ambrose Pereira. \u201cImagine when you have people from outside. How do you cater to them? How do you provide health, for example, or education or employment?... While we are open and we would welcome them, we cannot cater to them because we cannot even cater to our own people.\u201d He said PNG people were ready to help Australia and the men, but \u201cperhaps Australia needs to take up their responsibility more seriously and say, \u2018We have brought them in, we need to settle them\u2019 \u2026 this was only supposed to be a processing centre in operation for a year.\u201d The PNG government has been widely accused of prioritising Apec over the health and wellbeing of its people. The country is in the grips of a medication shortage, an outbreak of polio, increased rates of tuberculosis, and funding crises in health and education. Last week a nationwide strike was called to protest against the government\u2019s purchase of 40 Maseratis and three Bentleys, purportedly to drive Apec dignitaries around.", "0||\u2018Understated Halloween\u2019: Japan embraces low-key cosplayWhile thousands donned meticulously assembled costumes and caused mayhem in central Tokyo, other people in Japan opted to mark Halloween in a more reserved fashion. An \u201cUnderstated Halloween\u201d event was held in the Shibuya district of Tokyo where \u201cflashy fancy dress\u201d was banned in favour of dressing up to recreate everyday scenes and encounters from Japanese life that elicited nods of recognition to shoulder-shaking mirth after photos of the event went viral on social media. The images were widely shared among Twitter users in Japan over the weekend, serving as an antidote to the mass exhibitionism that has come to define traditional Halloween celebrations in the capital\u2019s Shibuya district. The tableaux included the apprentice hairdresser who has cut too much hair off a speechless customer, an actor in his 20s forced to play a high school pupil, and a traveler who, on returning to Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport from warmer climes, realises he is inadequately dressed. Some targeted the corporate world, including an ad for a hay fever nasal wash, a Uniqlo mannequin and \u201cthe kind of model you see on cheap Korean fashion mail order sites\u201d. There was room, too, for takes on celebrity memes, exemplified by \u201cKeanu Reeves eating lunch alone.\u201d One of the Japanese co-organisers of the event, which was held in Shibuya, encouraged people to keep spreading the Understated Halloween message to English speakers. Mulboyne, a Tokyo resident, was among those who had obliged, creating a single thread that attracted dozens of messages from grateful users in Japan and beyond. \u201cI first heard of this event a couple of years ago but only ever saw one or two characters, and didn\u2019t really understand what they were doing. This year, I heard my wife giggling ... that led me to the dailyportalz site. They seemed so clever, and many were a great reflection of the way Japanese people can be keen observers of tics, foibles, and minor social dilemmas,\u201d he said. Not surprisingly for a country with a long tradition of cosplay and an appetite for American culture, Japan has embraced Halloween with an enthusiasm matched in few other countries. While the US tradition of dishing out sweets to trick-or-treating children seems to be confined to police officers and yakuza gangsters, for many young Japanese, wearing a costume \u2013 from the macabre to the playful \u2013 and comparing their handiwork in bars, clubs, and on the street has become an unmissable annual event. Japan, though, is less prepared for impromptu gatherings of costumed hordes at popular spots like Shibuya\u2019s scramble crossing, where more than a dozen people were arrested last week for groping and theft. One group overturned a small truck, while volunteers spent the early hours of morning cleaning up huge quantities of rubbish left behind by their fellow revellers. For businesses, residents and the police, Halloween Japan-style may be more trouble than it\u2019s worth.", "30||Six of the best artisan distilleries in ChicagoChicago has got history when it comes to spirits. The city was a vocal centre of the temperance movement that led to Prohibition between 1920 and 1933, which in turn fuelled the illegal and widespread production of moonshine and rise of Al Capone\u2019s speakeasies. Today the city boasts a booming artisan distillery scene, the new generation producing small batch bourbon and rye whiskey, botanical gin and vodka, and even mezcal, kirsch and absinthe. Many have their own cocktail bars for those who want to make a night of it after a spirit-tasting tour. Tours and cocktails are generally priced at $10 \u2013 here are six of the best to check out. Maplewood Brewery &amp; Distillery The red-brick Maplewood Lounge has become a hot venue since it opened a few months ago \u2013 unsurprisingly given that it is run by Chicago\u2019s only microbrewery-meets-distillery. The Lounge is the front room of a bigger production space filled with oak barrels ageing whisky and a hybrid pot and column still, alongside towering beer fermentation tanks. The young owners are experimenting with half a dozen single malt varieties, all influenced by their beers, plus a clear non-oaked rum that is perfect in their retro, but lethal, frozen pina colada, as well as a malty Brewers Gin. The whiskies are rich and caramelised, sometimes even chocolatey when using stout barley. Master distiller Ari Megalis says: \u201cI learnt my distilling the same way we learnt our beer brewing \u2013 at home in the garage,\u201d and while the whisky is excellent neat, it is difficult to resist the Lounge\u2019s dozen creative cocktails, especially the old fashioned, which mixes clear \u201cwhite\u201d whiskey with homemade bitters and a syrup made from their Fat Pug stout. \u2022 Tours begin in 2019, cocktails $10, 2717 North Maplewood Avenue, maplewoodbrew.com Koval Distillery A pioneer of Chicago\u2019s reborn distilling scene, Koval was founded by Robert and Sonat Birnecker, fourth-generation Austrian distillers who have made an international name for themselves with their signature range of bourbon and rye. In the chic Ravenswood suburb by Lake Michigan, this is a grain-to-bottle operation: it deals directly with local organic farmers; carries out on-site milling and mashing; then small-batch distilling. Koval\u2019s popular tours take place in the original distillery, now used for barrel-ageing, along with a tasting bar and alembics. You can pop in and taste any time, but the organised tour is the thing \u2013 guests are quickly enthralled by entertaining guide Emily Williams. After an explanation of the distilling system, the atmosphere gets lively as she starts serving everyone a good selection of the Koval range, using a giant plastic syringe to add a dash of theatre. There are cocktail classes too. \u2022 Tour and tasting $10, tours Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, 5121 North Ravenswood Road, koval-distillery.com CH Distillery A popular downtown venue in the West Loop, CH has a lively after-work cocktail bar with a glass wall looking into the distillery, a menu of Cajun cuisine and regular tours. CH does not stand for Chicago but rather carbon and hydroxyl, the two fundamental compounds in alcohol, and its Science of Alcohol Tour goes into the alchemy of distillation, including tasting the deadly top and tail alcohol of the process (which is so strong that bubbly guide Myra insists is can be used as a cleaning disinfectant). After this, you\u2019ll understand why pure distilled alcohol needs to be watered down to make it drinkable. CH made its name with unique craft vodkas distilled from organic Illinois grain, and five are tasted in iced shot glasses accompanied by rye bread topped with pickled gherkin. But the distillery\u2019s founder, Tremaine Atkinson, loves experimenting, so it is difficult to resist trying the rest of the CH range: gin, mezcal and aquavit, bourbon and gin, plus offbeat takes on amaro and Fernet-Branca. \u2022 Tour and tasting $15, Saturdays only, 564 West Randolph Street, chdistillery.com Rhine Hall A tour of Rhine Hall\u2019s distillery is the chance to discover Chicago\u2019s latest hotspot, Fulton Street, a 19th-century covered market converted into hip diners, bars, delis and cocktail lounges. The father and daughter team behind Rhine Hall, Charlie and Jennifer Solberg, specialise in fruit brandies, distilling pear, plum, and cherry (known as eau-de-vie and schnapps), plus an oaked calvados-style apple brandy. (Charlie got a taste for amateur schnapps distilling when he was a professional hockey player in Austria \u2013 Rhine Hall is the name of his team\u2019s arena \u2013 and set up a wobbly moonshine still in his garden when he got back to Chicago.) Guests walk into a roomy saloon bar where there is a creative selection of cocktails made with fruit brandies, while the distillery is right behind the bar, where rock\u2019n\u2019roll master-distiller Pete mixes exotic concoctions like pineapple and mango brandy. Distilling is very much seasonal here, with most of the fruits coming from the Great Lakes region, though Rhine has just launched a beer schnapps, distilling beer from a local Chicago craft brewer. \u2022 Tour and tasting $10, tours Wednesday-Saturday, 2010 West Fulton Street, rhinehall.com Chicago Distilling Company The sign outside this funky place says it all \u2013 Drink Local Booze. Right in the heart of Logan Square, Chicago\u2019s nightlife neighbourhood, this place opened as a small garage distillery, and really took off when the distiller converted the front space into a huge cocktail bar. Local mixologist Noah Roberts creates a stellar drinks list featuring only the distillery\u2019s spirits; gin, vodka, bourbon, whiskey and absinthe. The tasting takes place inside the distillery, where everything is done by hand, right down to sticking the labels and numbering the bottles, with owner Jay DiPrizio narrating: \u201cMy wife\u2019s family is from northern Wisconsin, where everyone still makes their own moonshine. We got the taste for this and decided to start our own project in Chicago. We went back to school, got our licence as distillers, and opened up in our local neighbourhood.\u201d Star of the show is their barrel-aged Finns Gin, made from 11 botanicals including cardamom, hibiscus and Szechuan pepper \u2013 a world away from standard juniper gins. G&amp;T is served on-tap \u2013 and tastes much better than that sounds \u2013 and locals love the canned cocktails (more of an acquired taste) for Lake Michigan beach picnics. \u2022 Tour and tasting $10, tours run most days, 2359 North Milwaukee Avenue, chicagodistilling.com Few Distillery A quick train ride from the skyscrapers of downtown Chicago takes you to the grand mansions of residential Evanston, a notable location for a distillery, perhaps, as this was home to the Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Movement, where it orchestrated the campaign for Prohibition. And Few still looks like a refugee of the speakeasy days, a dilapidated whitewashed brick warehouse, hidden down a back alley off respectable Main Street. You wonder how it manages to produce its outstanding range of small batch bourbon and rye in these chaotic surroundings as the tour weaves its way between sacks of cereals ready to be transformed into grain mash, piles of wooden barrels, stainless steel vats and copper pot and pipe stills. In the middle is a huge table that looks like a school chemistry lab, where the alchemist-distillers create new spirits. The tour is led by the amiable Zach Yates, who after discussing the art of distilling, walks guests through to a casual wood-panelled bar. Sitting on stools by the bar counter, there are half-a-dozen spirits to try, served in serious tasting glasses. You are encouraged to sniff, swirl and taste to get the full experience. \u2022 Tour and tasting $10, tours Wednesday-Sunday, 918 Chicago Avenue, Evanston, fewspirits.com", "0||Monday briefing: 'What kind of politics do we want?'Top story: Tale of two presidents This is Alison Rourke bringing you the top news stories on this Monday morning. Donald Trump and Barack Obama have headlined rallies with diametrically opposed calls to American voters. In a sign of just how febrile the midterm campaign has become, Trump set out his fear of an America overrun with criminals and socialists if Republicans fared badly in Tuesday\u2019s vote. He unleashed on the Democrat candidate Stacey Abrams from Georgia, who is vying to become the country\u2019s first female black governor: \u201cStacey Abrams wants to turn your wonderful state into a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens, putting innocent Georgia families at the mercy of hardened criminals and predators,\u201d Trump said. In Indiana, Obama laid out a picture of politics led by a man who had no qualms about lying or about playing to people\u2019s fears. \u201cWhat kind of politics do we want,\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat we have not seen at least in my memory is where, right now, you\u2019ve got politicians blatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly lying. Just making up stuff.\u201d He ridiculed Trump\u2019s focus in the final days of the campaign on the caravan of Central American asylum seekers: \u201cTwo weeks before the election they are telling us that the single greatest threat to America is a bunch of poor, impoverished, broken, hungry refugees 1,000 miles away.\u201d You can see the key midterm races, when to expect results and how to follow the poll here. * * * Irish border \u201850-50\u2019 \u2013 EU officials say the chance of Theresa May striking a deal on the Irish border that she can sell to her cabinet is \u201c50-50\u201d as talks enter their final stage. British and European negotiating teams begin a secretive phase known as the \u201ctunnel\u201d this week, with senior EU figures warning of \u201cincompatible\u201d key areas. The discussions come as more than 1,500 of the UK\u2019s top lawyers, including Labour peer Helena Kennedy QC and former court of appeal judge Konrad Schiemann, urged the PM and MPs to back a second Brexit referendum, saying that \u201cdemocratic government is not frozen in time\u201d. In a letter to May, they said parliament should not be bound by the 2016 vote any more than it should be by the 1975 referendum that took Britain into the EU, especially when there were question marks over its validity. * * * Obesity air pollution link \u2013 Pollution from cars and trucks increases the risk of children becoming obese, a new study has found. High levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is emitted by diesel engines, in the first year of life leads to significantly faster weight gain later. \u201cWe would urge parents to be mindful where their young children spend their time, especially considering if those areas are near major roads,\u201d said Jeniffer Kim, at the University of Southern California, who led the new research. You can read about why air pollution around the world is on the rise here, and the worst city\u2019s affected (half the the top 20 most polluted are in India). * * * \u2018Take greater responsibility\u2019 \u2013 The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, will today call on people to take responsibility for their own health, including calling for a big increase in healthier lifestyle choices, such as reducing the amount of alcohol and junk food they consume. \u201cPrevention is also about ensuring that people take greater responsibility for managing their own health,\u201d he will say. He will insist that his focus on people\u2019s individual responsibilities as patients \u201cisn\u2019t about penalising people\u201d and instead involves helping them make better choices, some of which involve \u201ctough decisions\u201d. Still on health and according to a new study, skin cancer rates among men in the developed world have soared over 30 years. In Britain cases have risen 70% according to the new research, while in Ireland and Croatia cases have roughly doubled. * * * Tower tribute \u2013 Ten thousand torches lit up the surrounds of the Tower of London on Sunday night in a tribute to fallen servicemen ahead of this year\u2019s 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war. \u201cI think it creates the right atmosphere for people to have their own personal reflections, and gives people time with their own thoughts,\u201d said Royal Navy midshipman, Balraj Dhanda. The torch ceremony, called Beyond the Deepening Shadow, will be repeated every night until Remembrance Sunday on 11 November. Today in Focus podcast: Inside the campaign to stop Brexit As Brexit negotiations gear up again this week, the campaign for a second referendum is gathering momentum. But who are the people trying to stop Brexit? We hear from James McGrory, the director of the People\u2019s Vote campaign. Plus: a week on from the synagogue shootings in Pittsburgh, Hadley Freeman reflects on the drivers of antisemitism in the United States. Lunchtime read: Fancy a four-day week? Imagine working for four days and getting paid for five. A handful businesses are adopting a shorter working week, which is being touted by some as the answer to the UK\u2019s \u201cproductivity problem\u201d. British people work some of the longest hours in Europe: the average worker takes only a 34-minute lunch break and works 10 hours overtime each week (more often than not, this is unpaid). Yet UK productivity lags seriously behind our European neighbours, who tend to work fewer hours. France recently made it illegal to expect workers to answer emails out of hours, and the average French worker produces more by the end of Thursday than their UK counterparts do in a full week. British working practices have taken their toll on the nation\u2019s health and happiness. More than half a million workers in the UK were signed off with work-related stress or anxiety last year. That amounts to 12.5m working days, and while it is difficult to quantify the financial cost of this, a 2014 study put it at nearly 4.5% of GDP. In some businesses, efficiency has made up for the loss of working hours. \u201cIn a lot of tech companies, time is lost to overly long meetings, or having beers in the last hour,\u201d says John Peebles, CEO of tech firm Administrate, who introduced the shorter week in 2015. \u201cBut what if we just worked really hard for 32 hours a week and didn\u2019t have any downtime?\u201d Sport England\u2019s second-half revival in the weekend\u2019s narrow win over South Africa has left Eddie Jones eager for his side to prove themselves against the best team in the world, the All Blacks. There is little certainty about England\u2019s lineup for Tuesday\u2019s first Test against Sri Lanka, with the pitch in Galle and the weather not helping Joe Root and Trevor Bayliss make up their minds on team selection. Manchester City\u2019s 6-1 dismantling of Southampton on Sunday illustrated just how difficult it will be to dethrone Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, while two goals from \u00c1lvaro Morata and a third from Pedro took Chelsea to a 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace. James Milner was the man who scored Liverpool\u2019s goal in their 1-1 draw with Arsenal on Saturday and, according to J\u00fcrgen Klopp, it was also the midfielder who offered some stern words to fire up his team at half-time. Mary Keitany of Kenya has become the second woman to win the New York Marathon four times, beating countrywoman Vivian Cheruiyot to victory by three minutes. And Tommy Makinson\u2019s outstanding hat-trick carried England to a series win over New Zealand and made clear the challenge for those in charge of shaping rugby league\u2019s future. Business More than 180,000 workers are set for an inflation-beating pay rise, as the UK living wage rises against a backdrop of increases in transport costs, private rent and council tax. The pay rate, a voluntary measure adopted by more than 4,700 employers, including Aviva, Burberry and Ikea, will increase by 2.9% to \u00a39 an hour across the country and by 3.4% to \u00a310.55 in London. The pound is buying \u20ac1.14 and $1.30. The papers The Guardian\u2019s main story today is \u201cChance of May striking Brexit deal is 50-50, say EU officials\u201d.

Multilateralism and the free trade system are under threat \u2026 China will not close its door to the world and will only become more and more open\u201d, the Chinese president said on Monday at the beginning of a trade fair in Shanghai. The speech, ahead of a meeting between Xi and US president Donald Trump at the end of the month on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Argentina, signalled little improvement in trade ties before that meeting. Xi claimed China had entered a \u201cnew round of high-level opening up\u201d but did not make any concrete concessions likely to satisfy the White House. The Chinese leader reiterated a pledge to enforce intellectual property rights, as well as open up the country\u2019s educational, cultural and telecommunications sectors, something officials have been promising for years, with little action taken. \u201cIt seems largely more of the same, and unlikely to have any impact on the trade war,\u201d said Roland Rajah, the director of the international economy programme at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. The US has accused China of unfair trade and business practices, including theft of US intellectual property, and imposed tariffs on $250bn in Chinese goods. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110bn worth of US goods. Without directly naming the US, Xi issued several veiled jabs at Trump who has blamed China for the loss of jobs in the US and a yawning trade imbalance. Xi said: \u201cAll countries should strive to improve their own business environment and solve their own problems. \u201cAs globalisation deepens, the practices of law of jungle and winner take all are a dead end,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese economy is a sea, not a pond. Storms can overturn a pond, but never a sea.\u201d Xi promised to accelerate trade talks with the EU, as well as Japan, and Korea. The president also said a new stock board would be set up in Shanghai for hi-tech companies. Xi\u2019s remarks failed to lift spirits on Asia\u2019s bruised stock markets, which endured a grim October under the shadow of a possible trade ar and rising US interest rates The Hang Seng index was off more than 2.1% in Hong Kong while the Shanghai Composite was down 1%. The yuan also fell slightly as the dollar firmed ahead of the US midterm elections. Amid the trade war, Chinese exports to the US have remained resilient, causing its trade surplus with the US to reach a record $31.05bn in August. Xi said China would import $40tn-worth of goods and services in the next 15 years, a figure that does not necessarily signal a meaningful increase given existing trends. Still, the Chinese economy has revealed signs of strain. China\u2019s economy in the third quarter grew at its weakest pace since the global financial crisis.", "0||Myanmar: imprisoned Reuters journalists launch appealLawyers in Myanmar have filed an appeal on behalf of jailed Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were imprisoned for reporting on the military\u2019s violence against the Rohingya, on the basis that the court\u2019s ruling was \u201cwrong\u201d. In September, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were sentenced to seven years for breaching the country\u2019s official secrets act after they were accused of being in possession of secret documents. In the appeal filed on Monday, lawyers acting for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo stated that \u201cin condemning them as spies, it ignored compelling evidence of a police set-up, serious due process violations, and the prosecution\u2019s failure to prove any of the key elements of the crime,\u201d according to a statement by Stephen J Adler, president and editor-in-chief of Reuters. \u201cContrary to Myanmar law, it shifted the burden of proof from the prosecution to Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.\u201d The drawn out trial of the journalists was widely regarded as a farce, where swathes of evidence that the pair were set up by the police was ignored or dismissed. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo always stood by their innocence and the real reason for their arrest and imprisonment is widely thought to be their in-depth reporting on the human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing carried out against the Rohingya muslim minority by the military in Rahkine state. The guilty verdict in June drew condemnation from the UN and governments across the world and was seen as a big step back for democracy and the rule of law in Myanmar. Many had hoped that Aung San Suu Kyi, who during her 15 years under hour arrest had been a vocal advocate of free speech, might pardon the pair. Instead she has defended their imprisonment. Adler added: \u201cNow is the time for Myanmar to uphold its stated dedication to rule of law, freedom of the press, and democracy by ordering the release of our colleagues, whether on appeal or by granting the families\u2019 request for a pardon.\u201d", "3||UK living wage rises above inflation rate for 180,000 workersMore than 180,000 workers are set for an inflation-beating pay rise, as the UK living wage rises against a backdrop of increases in transport costs, private rent and council tax. The pay rate, a voluntary measure adopted by more than 4,700 employers, including Aviva, Burberry and Ikea, will increase by 2.9% to \u00a39 an hour across the country and by 3.4% to \u00a310.55 in London. Set by the Living Wage Foundation, the rate is calculated by assessing what workers need to meet the basic cost of living in Britain, and is \u00a31.17 higher an hour than the national living wage imposed by the government for workers over the age of 25. The foundation encourages employers to introduce the new rates immediately, but UK Living Wage companies will be given until May next year to bring in the pay rises. The national living wage (the title chosen by the former chancellor George Osborne) is the statutory national minimum wage but for those over the age of 25. . It is set at \u00a37.83 an hour; it will rise to \u00a38.21 an hour from next April. For 21-24-year-olds, the current rate is \u00a37.38 and will rise to \u00a37.70; and the rate for 18-20-year-olds rises from \u00a35.90 to \u00a36.15. The increase in the UK living wage comes as British households face increasing pressure from higher living costs. Inflation rose sharply following the EU referendum in 2016 when the sudden fall in the value of the pound drove up the cost of importing goods to Britain. Although the effects have gradually begun to fade, the consumer price index measure of inflation remains at 2.4%, which is above the 2% target set by the government for the Bank of England. Threadneedle Street calculates that households have lost about \u00a3900 each since the Brexit vote as a consequence. Tess Lanning, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said more companies still needed to pay higher wages to help workers struggling with the rising cost of living in Britain. \u201cEmployers that pay the real living wage enable their workers to live a life of dignity, supporting them to pay off debts and meet the pressures of rising bills,\u201d she said. More than 1,200 organisations have signed up to pay the higher living wage in the past year, including Liverpool FC, the University of Bristol, the combined authority for the city region of Sheffield, and Aberystwyth University. These companies and public sector organisations are however the exception rather than the norm. More than a fifth of jobs pay less than the UK living wage, according to a study from the accountancy firm KPMG. Jobs paying below the UK living wage have also increased by about 1.2m since 2012, with part-time workers and people aged between 18 and 21 most likely to be below the threshold. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said that millions of people were struggling to make ends meet. \u201cThese new rates would make a big difference to Britain\u2019s lowest paid workers. But more companies need to sign up,\u201d she said. Growing numbers of employers may find they need to raise their wages to attract staff amid growing numbers of job vacancies, particularly in sectors such as retail, hospitality, agriculture and distribution, as fewer EU migrants choose to come to Britain following the Brexit vote. Amazon recently announced an inflation-beating pay rise for its UK workers, though it did not sign up to the commitments set by the Living Wage Foundation. Questions still also remain over working conditions at the online retailer. The lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s are starting to help workers demand greater pay increases. Average weekly earnings including bonuses increased at the fastest rate in almost a decade, with a rise of 3.1% in the three months to August compared to the same period a year ago. However, separate government figures show that more than 10 million workers received a pay rise of 1% or less last year. James Watt, founder of the craft beer company Brewdog, a Living Wage employer, said it made business sense to pay the living wage, adding that \u201cit\u2019s a shame that short-term mentalities and greed are still prevalent in many industries\u201d. He added: \u201cFar too many companies in the hospitality industry view their employees as transient and disposable and this is why wages are often low, turnover is high and dissatisfaction is the norm.\u201d", "14||Traidcraft eyes young ethical consumers with rescue planPioneering fair trade retailer Traidcraft, which had warned it was facing closure, has launched a turnaround plan that involves targeting younger ethical consumers. The faith-based group has traditionally relied on thousands of volunteers selling its coffee and tea at church hall stalls and school fairs. But in September the company warned it would cease trading unless it could come up with a profitable model after poor sales were compounded by the Brexit shock to the pound. Traidcraft chief executive Robin Roth said the organisation had drawn up a rescue plan after it received an avalanche of support in its darkest hour: \u201cI was very worried when I put the call out but we received hundreds of emails and it encouraged me not to give up.\u201d The Gateshead-based company, which turns 40next year, is shedding 80% of its 67 staff and outsourcing its warehouse. In the new year it will relaunch with a paid-for membership scheme that will entitle shoppers to a discount. It is also slashing its product range to focus on popular food stuffs such as coffee, tea, sugar and rice rather than handicrafts. Traidcraft had been struggling before Brexit as declining church attendance was compounded by the impact of austerity cuts on living standards. Sales had dropped from \u00a316.5m in 2010 to less than \u00a310m in the year to March when it recordeda loss of about \u00a3500,000. Over the past five years it has shed more than 1,000 of the volunteers who ran the weekend stalls, leaving it with around 4,300, many of whom are elderly. These stallholders generate half its sales. \u201cWe are the sort of business that pays up front,\u201d said Roth. \u201cSo when the pound fell after the Brexit referendum, we took a hit. We also stand by our published prices, so unlike other retailers we stood by our customers, absorbed a lot of the additional cost, and kept price rises to a minimum.\u201d In the 1980s and 90s Traidcraft helped bring fair trade products to the mainstream but Roth said it had gradually been \u201csidelined\u201d as the major supermarkets moved in to what is now a \u00a31.6bn market in the UK. To regain the upper hand it would now aim to set a more radical agenda by breaking down the price of its products to \u201cmake transparent the costs, prices and profits involved in every product it sells\u201d, Roth said. \u201cWe want to tell consumers who gets what from the Traidcraft products they buy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will push the boundaries of what people understand fair trade to be. We can\u2019t let supermarkets define that for us. We should be leading and they should be following. We will cause good trouble, just as those six fair trade pioneers who started Traidcraft did back in 1979.\u201d The organisation\u2019s future plans include tapping into new food trends such as the zero-waste shoppers who want to buy cooperatively and in bulk to avoid excess packaging. \u201cWhen new markets are searching for goods that are ethical, vegan and organic as well as fair trade, we need to be there,\u201d said Roth. \u201cWe need to address a younger audience. It\u2019s not enough to be church-based.\u201d", "5||The Deuce recap: season two, the finale \u2013 a rip-roaring changing of the guardSpoiler alert: this recap launches after The Deuce airs on Sunday nights in the US on HBO. Do not read unless you have watched season two, episode eight, which airs in the UK on Sky Atlantic on Tuesday at 10pm. \u2018Pimp is a role, so is whore. You pretended to be one and I pretended to be another. But once you start letting a girl inside the pretend, it\u2019s over. Ain\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2013 Darlene Let\u2019s start with this scene between Darlene and Larry. It was short, it was profound and it was moving. Two people said farewell to each other, knowing \u2013 as Darlene put it \u2013 that if things went right they would never see each other again. It was a parting of lovers, of a kind, but also the breaking of a bond. That\u2019s bond as in bondage; of Darlene freeing herself from her pimp. In the shape of these two characters the Deuce has told genuine stories of redemption. The pair have escaped cleanly, it seems, from the lives in which they appeared trapped. They have done so by breaking out of their roles and pursuing things they wanted as individuals; Darlene wanted to read, Larry wanted to act (so, yeah, he is still playing roles, but still). Both of them followed their new paths thoughtfully, without recourse to violence or to borrowing cash from the mob. In the final montage (of which more later), we see them continue to move forward in their new lives. Theirs is a feelgood story. Which is good because there aren\u2019t many others. In this extended length finale, Candy gets famous, and Red Hot, her erotic arthouse movie (or should that be arthouse erotica?), is doing \u201cboffo\u201d business at the box office. But is she happy? Well. She shrugs off the news that she and Harvey owe 115% of Red Hot\u2019s revenue to the mafia, thanks to Frankie\u2019s innumeracy. She also bids farewell to her schlubby boyfriend after catching him talking her down at her own movie premiere. Then there\u2019s the humiliating appearance on late-night network TV. But she deals with that, too. The clincher comes when Candy is punched in her weak spot. Turning up at her parents\u2019 home late one night and hoping to take her son on vacation as she had promised, she is confronted by her father. He has been a figure looming in the background throughout her story, and we know he committed Candy\u2019s brother to an asylum after he caught him cross-dressing. As thunder breaks above her and the rain comes down, Candy is barred from the house. For good. \u201cWhat do you think happens in a playground, when you tell the whole world who you are?\u201d her father asks, without a hint of compassion, before closing the door in her face. As Candy leaves, we see her son, Adam, in his bedroom having obviously been beaten up. To return to Darlene\u2019s point for a minute, Candy has been trying to create a new role for herself. She wants to become an auteur, someone who says: \u201cFuck normality.\u201d That\u2019s great, but it\u2019s not true to her whole self. It\u2019s also a role that can\u2019t be played out as freely as she hopes. It has its limits, at which point the normies start pushing back, whether they are chatshow hosts or playground bullies. Candy has hit those limits and now it is Eileen who suffers. A worse fate befell Dorothy. As with CC, it seemed likely that her increasingly difficult behaviour would have consequences. And as with CC she is dead, found behind a dumpster, wrapped in a rug. We do not know who killed Dorothy and nor are we likely to find out. The suspicion is that it was one of the pimps, but no one is going to try hard to find out. This is especially true of Alston who has finally succumbed to the offer of working with Gene Goldman and must now aim his sights at the mob. There is a funeral, as there was for the girl Kitty, and again nobody attends. Vince is there, in order to see it through, a promise he made to a distraught Abbie. While he is there, he notes that good-for-nothing Bobby has not even given Kitty a headstone. That about sums it up. For all the liberation that Darlene has experienced and the triumphs of Candy, it feels like Dorothy\u2019s experience is still the most representative for the women of the Deuce. There\u2019s another death, and another had-it-coming moment, with the demise of Rodney. Perhaps he had delusions of grandeur in robbing the pharmacy, believing himself to be an efficient gangster like, say, Melvin \u201cCheese\u201d Wagstaff from the Wire. Or maybe he just had glimpses of his former self, the sharply dressed, perceptive guy who could read Candy\u2019s mind as he tried to bring her under his spell. To cap it all off he walks out of the store to find himself confronted by a pissed-up policeman, bent cop Officer Haddix, who doesn\u2019t hesitate before firing four shots into Rodney\u2019s juddering body. Haddix even recognises his victim, but only after he has put him down. Farewell then, Rodney. Nobody will miss you. So that\u2019s it for season two, and we await the final instalment some time in 2019. We are left with a montage, set to the backdrop of the Pretenders\u2019 Mystery Achievement. I like montages, and this made me go back and watch the one from the beginning of the Sopranos\u2019 second season. (\u201cIt was very good year \u2026\u201d) That serves as a series opener and this one a closer, so they\u2019re there to do different things. But still I found it interesting that David Chase\u2019s concept, which felt so grandiose at the first time of watching, appears quite simple compared with that of The Deuce; in the way it is put together and the things it shows you about the participants. Each character gets little vignette that seems to show them in their element, but moves the story on a bit, Frankie cutting in Irene on his peep show scams, Rudy breaking bread (or bourbon) with the Horse. The Sopranos montage, meanwhile, is basically a load of middle-aged men having sex. Anyway, the final scene, the final image, goes to Vincent Martino, still the hero of this drama despite everything that has happened. Vince moves from the Hi Hat to the 366 and marches through crowds of revellers lost in disco decadence. He greets some, avoids others and lands behind the bar where he starts issuing instructions. He, too, is where he likes to be \u2013 \u201cto be at the centre of the world and never fucking sleep\u201d \u2013 so what\u2019s with the anxious thousand-yard stare? The guy who can smooth over any situation, who can pacify the mob and even patch things up with his ex-wife, is not at all at ease. We don\u2019t know why, although we can guess. In his anxiety, he may also reflect some of the confused feelings of those who have enjoyed watching this show. Thanks for reading and for sharing your comments.", "21||Guido Guidi: 'Many times I'm not looking when I press the shutter'Over the course of his 77 years, Guido Guidi has lived in the same neighbourhood just outside Cesena, a town in north-east Italy between Rimini and Bologna. It is flat, agricultural country, a landscape of straight lines: ploughed fields, a wide horizon, overhead wires, the long trundle of the old Roman road, the Via Aemilia, and the parallel rush of the A14 motorway. It is the landscape of his photographs, too, in which he has summoned up not the picture-postcard version of Italy, with its pretty countryside and medieval towns, but the peripheral, the overlooked and ordinary: the hastily built agricultural building by the highway; the straggle of buildings at the edge of town that the visitor usually rushes past. Even when he does venture into the centre \u2013 as in a series of images of Cesena from the early 1980s \u2013 he offers it up to the viewer as defiantly ungrand, shabby, a place like any other. A new book, Per Strada (On the Roads), which is accompanied by a small exhibition in London, draws together more than 200 photographs from the 1980s and 90s of this closely observed territory. He might show the corner of a rather plain church with a municipal rubbish bin shouldering into the shot; or heaps of blackened, weeks-old snow in front of a dingy palazzo with a bricked-up window; or the shuttered, blinded facade of a tobacconist\u2019s with a shadow playing delicately over it. For many years, eschewing digital technology, Guidi has mostly used a large-format, 25 x 20cm camera \u2013 the biggest and bulkiest he can carry on his own, he says, its negatives the same size as the resulting print. The detail is vast. In a photograph of an ordinary glass-fronted door there is such a material density to the cracked paint on its frame, the brass fittings of its lock, that the fact of the print\u2019s shiny flatness is almost overwhelmed. Reflected in the glass of the door is the image of a tree, slightly distorted by the faint curvature of the pane, and beneath it the ghostly faces of two children flanking the enigmatic black blob of the camera itself. Guidi is a small, neat man in Le Corbusier-style black glasses who speaks in immensely quiet, allusive sentences. He often quotes other photographers \u2013 Walker Evans, Lee Friedlander, Stephen Shore or his fellow Italian, Luigi Ghirri \u2013 or refers to the artists of the 15th century, such as Brunelleschi, Uccello and Fra Angelico, of whom he has an encyclopedic knowledge. We speak in his studio \u2013 in his house which he shares with his wife, Marta; over dinner at a nearby restaurant; and finally, over lunch in a local citizens\u2019 club. In these places he is greeted affectionately and sometimes teasingly by other elderly men, most of whom he has known his entire life. He relates his scrutiny of his territory\u2019s edgelands and peripheries to the facts of his own life. \u201cI was born in the countryside,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was not yet this \u2018edgeland\u2019, but biography and geography are bound together.\u201d Gradually, the margins of Cesena crept outwards and enveloped his home. The motorway was built close by; you can see its slip-road arching away, only 100 metres or so from his driveway. \u201cThe history of the city is like an egg,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ancient city was like a boiled egg, with clear edges bound by walls. Then the city became a fried egg, its edges spread out. Nowadays, it is a scrambled egg, with no form.\u201d When he was a student, studying design and architecture in Venice in the 50s, \u201cwe used to talk about this non-shape of the contemporary city. We were thinking about how to represent this city without form in art.\u201d Anyway, he points out, the periphery is not an objective point: one person\u2019s periphery is another\u2019s centre, and \u201cthe centre is where you are\u201d. He adds: \u201cIf you want, there is a subtle political message \u2013 though I would put it no more strongly than that \u2013 in my choosing to photograph this room, or one of my neighbour\u2019s houses.\u201d In this age of the scrambled-egg town, the centre is where the old monuments are, but not, for the most part, people\u2019s lives. And, while he acknowledges the importance of photography that captures great historical dramas \u2013 political speeches, wars \u2013 his work insists on the importance, even transcendence, of the apparently unremarkable. He mentions a recent exhibition in nearby Ravenna devoted to the work of Magnum photographer Alex Majoli, who was born and studied in the city; he is known for his work in conflicts such as the Afghanistan war. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single photograph of Ravenna in the exhibition,\u201d says Guidi, in wonderment. The photographs are often grouped in sequences, so that turning the pages of Per Strada you see a procession of similar shots following one from the other, or sometimes a single building shot from slightly different angles. (One series of his photographs, not part of this latest book, consists of 16 images taken in an empty room in Treviso during a single day; all that changes is that the square of light thrown from the window travels around the room). These sequences partly reflect the rhythm of his work. With his heavy camera it takes time to set up each shot, and his process is measured and slow compared with the speed at which photographers shooting digitally can work. \u201cMany times I\u2019m not looking when I press the shutter,\u201d he says. \u201cChance is very important.\u201d He doesn\u2019t crop: there\u2019s a kind of rigorous honesty to the pictures. Above all, the photographs argue against the idea of a \u201cdecisive moment\u201d, to quote the title of Henri Cartier-Bresson\u2019s most famous book \u2013 they refute the notion that the photographer\u2019s job is to capture a turning point, a denouement, to depress the shutter at the moment that captures the essence of an event or scene. According to Guidi: \u201cAll moments are decisive \u2013 and none.\u201d His work is not about the decisive moment but the \u201cprovisional moment\u201d \u2013 the idea that this moment is one of a procession of many. Very often, they show some kind of aperture \u2013 a doorway, a window, the arches of a portico, even the edge of the lens itself. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the game,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter all, a photograph is a frame, and if you put a frame in the picture, you are suggesting that this is not the whole world, that there is something outside.\u201d It\u2019s another form of honesty. With these gentle reminders that the picture is just a picture, he is showing his workings and hinting at his own subjectivity. One of the photographs in the book and exhibition stands apart from the others. It\u2019s not a landscape, but a still life: a dish of impossibly scarlet cherries sitting on a copy of the newspaper La Repubblica. You can\u2019t see the date on the paper, deliberately (though in fact the photograph was taken in 1985, and one of the headlines refers to that year\u2019s Italian presidential election). At one point, Guidi says that he considered using the image as a kind of frontispiece for the whole book. The image is a memento mori: those cherries will rot, that paper will be out of date tomorrow. That effect is all the more accentuated because, like all of the photos in the book, it was taken several decades ago: these other things too have passed, long ago. It\u2019s a reminder that memory and the photographic image are inextricably bound together. As Susan Sontag once wrote: \u201cTo remember is, more and more, not to recall a story but to be able to call up a picture.\u201d Guidi says: \u201cAll photographs are monuments. If you photograph this cup on the table, for example, it gives it importance. And over time, photographs become more and more like monuments.\u201d In the case of Guidi\u2019s pictures, modest monuments to the dignity of the everyday. Per Strada is published by Mack Books. The accompanying exhibition is at Large Glass, London, until 21 December.", "9||Lion poaching: the brutal new threat to Africa\u2019s prides\u201cThat\u2019s fresh, just a few hours old,\u201d says Kris Everatt, pointing at a clear print of a lion\u2019s paw in the hot dust. \u201cIt\u2019s the ghost pride.\u201d The print is female. A bigger male print is soon spotted, also leading towards a precious water hole, then a smaller one. \u201cA cub, less than two years old,\u201d he says. The anti-poaching patrol continues its careful tracking across the parched landscape of Limpopo national park (LNP) in Mozambique. Hippos wallow nearby, crocodiles sun themselves and baboons yell alarms calls at the rangers \u2013 but the team don\u2019t find the lions. Everatt, from the global wild cat conservation group Panthera, is pleased nonetheless. \u201cI\u2019m so happy \u2013 at least there are still lions here.\u201d The ghost pride, who live along the Machampane river, have very good reason for being elusive \u2013 they have been deliberately poisoned three times since 2015. Nine lions died, their faces and paws hacked off by the poachers, and the Limpopo park\u2019s lion population is in freefall. The targeted poaching attacks are a new and horrific danger to lions, which were already under serious threat across Africa from destruction of habitat and the snaring of their prey for bushmeat. There are now fewer lions left than elephants. \u201cPoaching has the potential to be incredibly detrimental to Africa\u2019s wild lions,\u201d says Everatt. \u201cThis is something we definitely didn\u2019t need \u2013 another huge challenge.\u201d \u201cIt happened really fast in Mozambique, and it could happen really fast in the rest of Africa,\u201d he says. Lion poaching has already been reported from Zimbabwe, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. \u201cYou could end up with the only place left with wild lions in Africa being Kruger national park,\u201d a well-protected refuge across the border in South Africa, he says. The poaching problem is especially worrying because it is far easier to poach lions than elephants or rhino. Lions scavenge, so poachers only need to snare an antelope, poison the carcass with pesticide and wait. \u201cI feel like I am racing the poachers to find the lions, and they have the advantage because they don\u2019t actually have to see the lions,\u201d says Everatt. \u201cLions are much easier to kill than to study.\u201d On the way back from the patrol, Everatt stops his Land Cruiser to watch African white-backed vultures circling a couple of hundred metres away \u2013 they could signal a predator kill and, perhaps, lions. Striding off, he kicks a rusted blue enamel bowl discarded in the dirt. \u201cPoachers,\u201d he spits. There are 20 or more vultures roosting in a tall dead tree, suggesting a big animal has been killed nearby. He walks downwind: \u201cI use smell all the time, so much so that the smell of a rotten animal is actually good to me now. I have found a lot of poaching incidents this way.\u201d But, again, no lions are found. Even technology doesn\u2019t guarantee a successful search. The day before, Everatt searched for a big male, Culu, who roams between Mozambique and Kruger national park, coming close to some infamous poaching villages. Everatt has collared Culu, but standing on top of his vehicle with an antenna listening for a radio beep, he found the lion elusive this time. \u201cI think Culu is going to be poached,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is kind of inevitable. There are a lot more poachers than rangers.\u201d LNP is roughly seven times the size of Greater London in the UK but has just 100 rangers in the field. Time is against the Limpopo lions. Their numbers have crashed from 66 to 21 in only five years, according to survey data soon to be published by Everatt. Based on the prey available, the area should support up to 200 lions. \u201cTargeted poaching has emerged over the last few years to be the number one threat to the viability of these lions,\u201d he says. \u201cThe decline is so steep that you would not expect lions to be around in the park in a couple of years\u2019 time.\u201d The change from 2014 is so stark that Everatt thinks that must be when criminals first showed up wanting to buy lion parts. Who is driving the demand for lion teeth and claws is unclear: illegal trade is by its nature shady. But they have turned up alongside elephant ivory and rhino horn in shipments destined for east Asia. There is also a local market in southern Africa for use in traditional magic. A few poached lions have also had their bones removed, potentially linking them to the controversial legal trade in farmed lion bones in South Africa. With just a few thousand tigers left, lion bones are now being used as replacement in Asian tiger cake and wine. Camera traps set for wildlife in LNP have snapped poachers returning from Kruger with tusks and rhino horn. But rhinos, already wiped out in LNP, are becoming rarer, so it appears lions are now being targeted as another way to make money, says Everatt: \u201cA lot of the time it is the same people, and often on the same trip.\u201d The most recent poaching attack in LNP hit the ghost pride in January: four lions died, along with dozens of vultures. One of Everatt\u2019s team broke down in tears at the sight of the mutilated carcasses. \u201cIt\u2019s gruesome and I do have an emotional reaction, but I try not to,\u201d he says. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t deal with it if you did. It just keeps happening. But such sights spurred Everatt to set up his six-strong Lion Unit in LNP. \u201cIf I had not, I think there would probably be none left.\u201d The unarmed unit, which has seized poison before it could be used and removed many bushmeat snares, is led on the ground by Samuel Bil\u00e9rio, a young veterinarian and trained ranger. \u201cWe are worrying about seeing poachers, as some have guns, but we have good morale,\u201d Bil\u00e9rio says. \u201cWe are not here to fight, but to protect the lions and teach people.\u201d Lack of education and opportunities for local people is a key issue, he says, with little tourism in LNP to date: \u201cIf I was born in one of the villages here, I would be the poacher, I wouldn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Tackling the conflict between villagers and the lions that sometimes kill their cattle is crucial, as the trade in lion parts now adds an extra incentive to retaliate. Corn\u00e9lio Miguel, the warden of LNP, says: \u201cIn the villages, they know these animals as their enemy.\u201d Lion guardian schemes are being developed, aiming to build on successful schemes in Zimbabwe and Kenya where villagers are employed to keep cattle safe and chase off lions with blaring vuvuzelas. The devastation of lion prey by snaring for bushmeat to eat or sell is another big problem, despite it being outlawed in LNP. One way this is being tackled is with 17 irrigation schemes to ensure food crops can survive droughts and that farmers can grow cash crops. Victor Sithole, who farms 110 cattle in the nearby village of Timhodzoene, says he has a problem with lions every few years, but adds: \u201cThe biggest issue is lack of water and grass.\u201d LNP is also relocating 2000 families from eight villages in LNP to outside the park. It\u2019s a difficult choice, says Miguel: \u201cSometimes you have to make the right decision for conservation.\u201d The park authorities welcome the help Everatt\u2019s unit is giving to their anti-poaching efforts, which have stepped up in this year. \u201cIt is a fantastic concept,\u201d says Peter Leitner, project director at LNP. \u201cIt is showing a presence in areas we would not have got to.\u201d LNP has also brought in expertise from the DAG Conservation Trust, set up by a former army colonel from Zimbabwe. There are 26 people in the team and two helicopters to chase poachers. \u201cThere have been a lot of contacts in the past two months,\u201d says coordinator Sean van Niekerk. \u201cThey usually run. But if the guys have rhino horn, you are in for a fight.\u201d A computer screen in their operations tent shows 12 poacher groups tracked across the park in September alone. The lion poaching epidemic has also struck South Africa, but here captive lions \u2013 which outnumber wild lions \u2013 are the target. Tzaneen Lion and Predator Park, near Kruger, houses 60 lions and has been hit three times in three years, leaving nine lions dead and with their faces, paws and tails hacked off. \u201cIt is disgusting to see the animals cut up in front of you,\u201d says park manager Jeanine vd Vyver. \u201cBut if you are poor, it is a very good way to earn money in one go.\u201d She thinks the criminals may earn 25,000 to 55,000 rand ($1,800-$3,900) per lion. Kelly Marnewick from the Endangered Wildlife Trust in Johannesburg says 71 captive lions have been poached in the last two years: \u201cIt certainly shows there is demand for this product.\u201d That is a worry for captive and wild lions alike, say researchers. Andrew Loveridge, a Zimbabwean lion scientist from the University of Oxford, UK, says: \u201cIncidents where lions have been specifically targeted by poachers are a huge concern.\u201d Research shows \u201can escalating trend in the trade of lion products is an increasing threat to some national populations\u201d. Researchers are now trying to establish what is driving the demand, he says: \u201cWe do know that trophy hunters have been approached for access to lion carcasses [after skull and skin is removed], with up to $1,000 a carcass offered.\u201d In LNP, all those involved in conservation are optimistic that the annihilation of wildlife seen in past years can be turned around and that LNP has the potential to one day rival the incredible density of wildlife seen in Kruger, which is visited by 1.8 million tourists year. \u201cLNP could be full of wildlife,\u201d says Everatt. \u201cWe are increasing our presence on the ground, we are seeing more, chasing more and finding more,\u201d says Miguel. \u201cWith all our efforts we are moving to a better place \u2013 but poaching is still a challenge.\u201d Back out in the bush by the Machampane river, Bil\u00e9rio remains on the trail of the ghost pride. They remain in deadly peril. With his team, he has been their protector for six months now and remains resolute. \u201cI will see them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey will not die before I see them.\u201d", "28||PC World can't repair my laptop \u2013\u00a0but won't write it off eitherI bought a Compaq laptop in 2009 from PC World for \u00a3449 and took out the firm\u2019s Coverplan at \u00a38.99 a month. I did so because my previous laptop had been damaged, and I was forced borrow money to replace it. In 2014, the USB ports became faulty and I sent it off to be repaired by Coverplan but, when it came back, the problem persisted. Ever since, the cycle of sending it off to have it \u201cfully repaired\u201d only to find the same problem still existed, has been repeated. On the fourth return, the laptop wouldn\u2019t even boot up so I requested a write-off. My frustration is that I\u2019ve been paying this Coverplan the entire time, but have not had a fully functioning laptop. I\u2019m very aware I\u2019ve now paid enough for a replacement laptop several times over, which is galling. However, I\u2019ve been loath to cancel it. PC World says it is only suitable for a write-off when it feels it can\u2019t repair it any more. SWA, Guildford This letter is a wake-up call to anyone paying to cover an electronic item \u2013 promoted heavily at Currys PC World. If you have been paying \u00a39 a month for eight years plus, that\u2019s more than \u00a3800 to the insurer \u2013 enough to have bought two new laptops. One of the problems with these policies is often the company will insist on repairing the item even when it would be cheaper to throw it away and replace it. We asked PC World \u2013 now part of Dixons Carphone group \u2013 and it was quick to offer a solution. It says: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry to hear of the issues SWA had in getting her laptop repaired. We have now given her a voucher to replace it with a new machine and apologise for the inconvenience. \u201d You won\u2019t be insuring the new laptop.

Is it a comedy, a piss-take or a heartfelt spine-tingler? It certainly makes you jump, as lights flicker, wild squawks puncture the silence and Sutherland\u2019s Father David Smith tries to drive evil out of a traumatised family home. But this is no straightforward bone-chiller. The dramatic register switches as unpredictably as the temperature in Sutherland\u2019s haunted house, as deadpan ghost story becomes broad comedy becomes knowing onstage cultural critique. I only ever had a fleeting sense of what Sutherland was getting at, but it\u2019s got something to do with the theory advanced by Father David\u2019s exorcism guru, that demonic possession is a form of conceptual art. And so the show unfolds as a battle between a disembodied artist, forever embroiling his victims in new conceptual and narrative worlds, and a priest-cum-critic, dispelling them with \u2013 well, a pop song, as it happens. Presumably that\u2019s the exorcism equivalent of a one-star review. Sutherland by turns narrates and acts out Father David\u2019s gruelling journey, which messes with his (and our) heads. Is he an apprentice exorcist at all, or is this a fever dream in which he must slay the demons of a lifetime of guilt and mediocrity? I couldn\u2019t answer that question with any certainty, but I can promise that Sutherland\u2019s show \u2013 in Rob Watt\u2019s taut production \u2013 makes for intriguing, distinctive viewing. When he needs to, Sutherland gets just right the slightly numbed cadences and thousand-yard stare of the survivor of spiritual assault. Real tension is stoked at what might be round the next corner \u2013 even if that\u2019s another comic set piece, as the artist/demon starts dredging the bottom of the creative barrel. The meaning of it all is elusive, which is partly the point, I suspect, of an enterprise that\u2019s cynical about trite narrative closure. It\u2019s a show that pulls the rug out from under you so many times you begin to doubt there\u2019s anything solid underfoot whatsoever.", "8||Why we still can\u2019t stop talking about Jamal KhashoggiI failed to call it. The day after Jamal Khashoggi disappeared, I told editors that the story, unfortunately, would not hold attention for more than two or three days, so jaded was I with how Saudi\u2019s brutality had become normalised. It is now more than a month since Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, never to be seen again, but his killing has scarcely been out of the headlines since. It has focused attention on Saudi Arabia in ways that activists, journalists, human rights organisers and politicians have desperately tried but failed to do for years. This is not because Khashoggi was a journalist and that the media always raise the alarm for one of their own tribe. Numerous journalists have been killed or abducted whose stories never captured the press\u2019s \u2013 never mind the public\u2019s \u2013 attention like the death of Khashoggi. And it is not because he was particularly high-profile. He was certainly networked in media circles but was far from a household name. He was also not an opposition leader. There are other, more outspoken, politically organised Saudis in political exile who were more likely targets for the royal family\u2019s ire. His self-imposed exile raised eyebrows in the Arab world for those who follow the twists and turns of Saudi politics, but beyond that did not register on a wider scale. Despite his decamping to the US, Khashoggi was regarded as a friendly critic of the Saudi government who weighed his words carefully, never advocated regime change, and was in regular contact with senior members of the royal family. For someone who was really known only among the inner circles of politics and media, it made little sense that within days of his disappearance everyone, everywhere, seemed to be talking about him. There was something about this event, something that landed in a way that no one could have anticipated. There was an element of shocking betrayal; to be murdered in one\u2019s own consulate, a place of refuge in a foreign land, was akin to being murdered in a church. To be lured, then stung. It was a violation of amnesty that made it more sickening than if he had been liquidated randomly on the streets of Istanbul. It was reminiscent of Saddam Hussein\u2019s amnesty to his two sons-in-law who had fled the country, only to be assassinated the moment they returned. On the back of his murder, other atrocities committed by the Saudi regime have come into clearer focus. Arms deals with the kingdom are under greater scrutiny, with Germany halting future sales. The war in Yemen, which Saudi critics have been trying to call attention to for years, is suddenly higher up the agenda. Reporting from the ground has amplified the voices of doctors tending to starving children, incensed at how Khashoggi\u2019s murder received so much of the airtime that they would be grateful for scraps of. \u201cWe\u2019re surprised the Khashoggi case is getting so much attention while millions of Yemeni children are suffering,\u201d a doctor told the New York Times. \u201cNobody gives a damn about them.\u201d Last week, the US called for a \u201ccessation of hostilities\u201d in the Yemen war to be implemented within 30 days. We cannot anticipate what horrors make an impact with the public and thus their governments. There is a certain spot, an intersection of moral abhorrence and personalisation, that unlocks sympathy and outrage. It is, of course, a failure that the world has not paid enough attention to the war in Yemen, but it is also a feature of human psychology, one that allows us to process the death of one known person, rather than millions of anonymous ones. Jamal Khashoggi was the equivalent of the little girl in the red coat in Steven Spielberg\u2019s Schindler\u2019s List. The film was shot entirely in black and white, but a single girl was in colour, taken away from home with her family, playing in the mud in a concentration camp, and then piled up lifeless with other bodies on a cart. The technique identified the single story among millions, sharpening and humanising it to highlight what psychologists call \u201ccollapse of compassion\u201d, our natural tendency to turn away from mass suffering. It is why images of distressed individuals sear themselves in history\u2019s eye, rather than all the mass of detail that is known about a war or a famine. It is why one individual can spark national uprisings, why the Tunisian vegetable seller Mohammed Bouazizi setting himself on fire unleashed passions across the Arab world, and why the trials of the thousands of incarcerated or tortured did not. Rather than be dismissed as a fluke, a disproportionately indulgent treatment of a story centred on one member of the Saudi and media elite, the murder of Khashoggi is an opportunity, a martyrdom in fact, that should be pressed into the service of highlighting the callous and consistent brutality of the Saudi government towards its own people and its adversaries. It should also trigger a reappraisal of the cowardly realpolitik logic of security cooperation that western allies invoke to justify appeasement that is, in fact, increasingly a threat to stability in the Middle East. Already there is a different approach; more alarm. The death of two Saudi sisters who had sought asylum in the United States, found taped together in the Hudson river, is clearly receiving more coverage than would have been extended before the murder in Istanbul. Khashoggi\u2019s death may have been a tragedy, but it is possible that it helps the world to see all the rest of the Saudi government\u2019s victims also as tragedies, rather than statistics, or collateral damage. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist", "5||Monday\u2019s best TV: Doing Money; Brexit: What the Nation Really ThinksDoing Money 9pm, BBC Two Based on a true story, this feature-length one-off drama follows a young Romanian woman, Ana, who is snatched from a London street and sex-trafficked by a gang running brothels in Ireland.
